PREFACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Japanese</span> boys have not been introduced
very much to their little American friends,
and the purpose of this book is to provide
an introduction by telling some of the
experiences which are common to most
Japanese boys of the present time, together
with some account of the customs
and manners belonging to their life. I can
at least claim that the story is told as it
could be only by one who had actually
lived the life that is portrayed. I have
endeavored to hold the interest of my
young readers by bringing in more or less
of amusement. The little girl companion
is introduced to widen the interest and add
somewhat more of the story element than
would otherwise be present. The sketches
composing the various chapters are necessarily
disconnected, but they form a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
of pictures, priceless at least to the author,
which foreign eyes have seldom been allowed
to see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I suppose</span> I don&#8217;t need to tell you exactly,
my little friends, when and where I was
born, because Japanese names are rather
hard for you to remember, and then I don&#8217;t
want to disclose my age. Suffice it to say
that I was once a baby like all of you and
my birthplace was about a day&#8217;s journey
from Tokyo, the capital of Japan. I wish
I could have observed myself and noted
down every funny thing I did when very
small, as the guardian angel, who is said
to be standing by every cradle, will surely
do. But when my memory began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
serviceable, I was well on in my infancy,
and if I were to rely on that only, I should
have to skip over a considerable length of
time. How I should dislike to do this!
So, my little friends, let me construct this
chapter out of bits of things my mamma
used to tell me now and then.</p>

<p>When I was born, my father was away.
Grandma was very proud to have a boy
for the first-born, and at once wrote him
a letter saying that a son was born to him
and that he was like&mdash;and then she wrote
two large circles, meaning that I was very,
very plump. Do you know how a plump
Japanese baby looks? I have often wondered
myself, and have many a time
watched a baby taking a bath. Let us suppose
him to be one year old and about to
be put into warm water in a wooden tub.
His chin is dimple-cleft, his cheeks ripe as
an apple, and his limbs are but a continuation
of his fat trunk. And how jolly the
elfin is! After the queer expression he has
shown on being dipped has passed away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and he realizes what he is about, he will
make many quick bows&mdash;really, I assure
you, to show his thanks for the trouble of
washing him. At this, mother, sister, and
the maid assisting them give a burst of
laughter, when, with a scream of immense
delight, he will strike his fists into the
water, causing a panic among the well-clad
and not-ready-to-get-wet attendants. With
royal indifference, however, he will then
try to push his fist into his mouth, and not
grumbling at all over his ill-success, he
will set about telling a story with his everlasting
mum-mum. Now he is taken out
and laid on a towel. Glowing red, how he
will move his arms and legs like an overturned
turtle! Well, that is how I looked,
I am very sure.</p>

<p>In Japan, in christening a child, we follow
the principle of &#8220;A good name is
better than rich ointment.&#8221; I was named
Sakae, which in the hierographic Chinese
characters represents fire burning on a
stand. The idea of illumination will perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
suggest itself to you at once, and
indeed, it means glory or thrift. And my
well-wishing parents named me so, that I
might thrive and be a glory to my family.
So I was bound to be good, wasn&#8217;t I? A
bad boy with a good name would be very
much like a monkey with a silk hat on.</p>

<p>Now begins my walking. Now and then
mamma or grandma would train me, taking
my hands and singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Anyo wa o-jozu,</div>
<div class="verse">Korobu wa o-heta.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But my secret delight&mdash;so I judge&mdash;was
to stand by myself, clinging to the convenient
checkered frames of paper screens,
which covered the whole length of the
veranda. When I went from one side to
the other, at first without being noticed&mdash;of
course walking like a crab&mdash;and then
suddenly being discovered with a shout of
admiration, I used to come down with a
bump, which, however, never hurt me&mdash;I
was so plump, you know. I must describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
here a sort of ceremony, or rather an
ordeal, I had to pass through when I was
fairly able to stand and walk without any
help. For this I must begin with my house.</p>

<p>My house stood on the outskirts of the
town, where the land rose to a low hill
and was covered with tea-plants. We
owned a part of it hedged in by criptomerias.</p>

<p>We were not regular tea dealers, but
we used to have an exciting time in the
season preparing our crop. Lots of red-cheeked
country girls would come to pick
the leaves, and it was a sight to see them
working. With their heads nicely wrapped
with pieces of white and blue cloth, jetting
out of the green ocean of tea-leaves, they
would sing peculiarly effective country
songs, mostly in solos with a short refrain
in chorus. But they were not having a
concert, and if you should step in among
them, they would make a hero of you, those
girls. And then we had also a good many
young men working at tea-heaters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Here they likewise sang snatches of
songs, but their principal business was
to roll up steamed leaves and dry them
over the fire. But when work is combined
with fun, it is a great temptation for a boy,
and I, a lad of five or six, I remember,
would have a share among them, and,
standing on a high stool by a heater and
baring my right shoulder like the rest,
would join more in a refrain than in rolling
the leaves.</p>

<p>But I was going to tell you about the
ceremony I had to pass through, wasn&#8217;t I?
Well, it happened, or rather somebody
especially arranged it so, I suspect, that I
should have it just at the time of this
great excitement. The ceremony itself is
like this. They take a child fairly able
to walk, load him with some heavy thing,
and place him in a sort of a large basket
shaped like the blade of a shovel. Now
let him walk. The basket will rock under
him, the load is too heavy for him, and he
will fall down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>If he does, it is taken for granted that
he has in that one act had all the falls that
he would otherwise meet in his later life.
So, if he appears too strong to stumble, he
will be shaken down by some roguish hands
before he gets out of it.</p>

<p>I was to go through this before august
spectators&mdash;country girls. They liked
to see me plump, because some of them
were even more plump than I. At
any rate, from everywhere they saluted
me as &#8220;Bot&#8217;chan,&#8221; &#8220;Bot&#8217;chan.&#8221; If
I had returned every salute by looking
this way and that, I should have
broken my neck. But it was customary
to make a bow anyway, and I was
ordered by my mamma to do so. On
this occasion I made two snap bows with
my chin, which excited laughter. Now a
basket was produced, a brand-new one, I
remember, and I was loaded with some
heavy rice cake. I stood up, however, like
Master Peachling of our fairy-tale, who
is said to have surprised his adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mother by rising in his bathtub on the very
day of his birth! I was then placed in the
basket and made to walk.</p>

<p>I looked intently at the basket, not because
it was new, but because it gave me a
queer motion, the ups and downs of a
boat, a new sensation to me, anyway.
Attracted, however, by the merry voices of
the crowd, I looked at them, and suddenly,
being pleased with so many smiling faces,
raised a cry of delight, when down I came
with a loud noise. A roar of laughter
broke out with the clapping of hands. The
noise buried my surprise and I also clapped
my hands without knowing who was being
cheered.</p>

<p>As the first-born of the house, I must
have had lots of playthings. But there
were two things I remember as clear as
the day. One was a sword, all wood, however.
As the son of a samurai, I should
have had to serve my lord under the old
régime and stake my life and honor on
the two blades of steel. And so even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the good old days were gone, something to
remind us of them was kept and made a
plaything of. But really, I liked my
wooden sword. The other thing was a
horse&mdash;a hobby-horse, I mean. I don&#8217;t
know just how many horses I had, but I
wanted any number of them. I had some
pictures, but they were all of horses. If
not, I would not accept the presents. And
with these two kinds of treasures I enjoyed
most of my childhood days, the
sword slantingly on my side, and the horse,
which I fancied trotting, under me, while
I shouted &#8220;Haiyo! haiyo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Although I had my own name, people
called me &#8220;Bot&#8217;chan,&#8221; as I have said, because
it is a general term of endearment,
and papa and mamma would call me
&#8220;Bô&#8221; or &#8220;Bôya.&#8221; Among those who
addressed me thus, I remember very well
one middle-aged woman who often came
to steal me from mamma, and by whom
I was only too glad to be stolen.</p>

<p>We had a long veranda facing the garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
on which I passed most of my days.
There I rode on my hobby-horse or played
with my little dog Shiro, who would go
through all sorts of tricks for a morsel of
nice things. Suddenly my laugh would
cease and nothing of me would be heard.
Wondering what the matter was, mamma
would open the paper screen to see, and
lo! not a shadow of me was to be seen.
Even Shiro had disappeared. Attacked
with a feeling something akin to horror,
she used to picture&mdash;so I imagine&mdash;a
winged tengu (a Japanese harpy) swooping
down and carrying me away to some
distant hill. But soon finding recent steps
of clogs on the ground, coming to and receding
from the veranda, she would nod
and smile at the trick. She knew that I
had been kidnapped by a good soul!</p>

<p>Now I want to give you some reasons
why I liked this woman. First of all, it
was because she always carried me on
her back. The only way to appreciate what
it is to be tall, would be to be a grown-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
man and a small child at the same time.
And that is exactly the feeling that I had.
I could see lots of curious things over the
forbidden hedges. I could even see things
over the house-tops; they were all one-story,
and built low, though. In a word,
I always felt while on her back like a wee
pig who had first toddled out into a wide,
wide world. And then she would carry me
through town. What life there was! After
crossing a bridge which spanned the
stream, coming from the beautiful lake on
the north and going a little way along a
row of pine-trees, we would come on a flock
of ducks and geese on their way to the
water. What a noise they made,&mdash;quack,
quack! Then we would begin inspecting
rows of houses, open to the street and in
which all sorts of things were sold. Men,
women, and children, as well as dogs,
seemed to be very much occupied. Then I
would spy some horses laden with straw
bags and wood. Real horses they were,
but I was rather disappointed to find them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
so big and their appearance not half so
good as in my pictures. My faith in them
always began to shake a little bit, but still
I used to persist in thinking that my hobby-horses
and pictures were nearer the reality
than those we met on the street. And
wasn&#8217;t it curious that my belief was at last
substantiated by seeing a Shetland pony
in America after some twenty years? Ah,
that was exactly what I had in mind!</p>

<p>Then I would hear a merry prattle on a
drum&mdash;<i>terent-tenten, terent-tenten</i>. Ah,
here would come boy acrobats dressed in
something like girls&#8217; gymnasium suits,
with a small mask of a lion&#8217;s head with a
plume on it, on their heads. A funny sort
of boy, I thought, but on my woman&#8217;s giving
them some pennies, they would perform
all sorts of feats which interested me never
so much. The woman used to shake me
to make sure that I was not dead, as I
kept very quiet, watching.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s house was just behind the
street, and she was sure to take me there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Here was another reason why I liked her
very much. She seemed to know just what
I wanted. She would set me on the sunny
veranda and bring me some nice o-dango
(rice dumpling). This she made herself,
and it was prepared just to my liking,
covered well with soy and baked deliciously.
I was in clover if I only had that!</p>

<p>I will describe one of my visits, which
will well represent them all. The day was
calm and bright, and while we were feasting&mdash;she
had some of the good things, too&mdash;her
pussy sat on one end of the veranda
and was finishing her toilet in the sun.
Even the sparrows in this peaceful weather
forgot that they were birds of air, and
fell from the trees and were wrestling
noisily on the ground. Only the pussy&#8217;s
move broke up their sport. By this time
we were very near the end of our business.
Turning from the sparrows, my
woman glanced at me and sat for a moment
transfixed with the awful sight I
presented. There I was with my cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and nose all besmeared with brown soy,
stretching my sticky hands in a helpless
attitude, and licking my mouth by way of
variation. She now broke into laughter
and was scrambling on the floor, weak with
merriment. But my mute appeal was too
eloquent; indeed, I was all ready to shed
tears with an utter sense of helplessness
when she hastened to bring a wet towel and
wipe my face and hands clean and nice,
with, &#8220;Oh, my poor Bot&#8217;chan!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> family consisted of father, mother,
grandmother, and two children besides
myself, at the time when I was six years
old. I don&#8217;t remember exactly what business
my father was in, but my impression
is that he had no particular one. He had
been trained for the old samurai and devoted
most of his youthful days to fencing,
riding, and archery. But by the
time he had come of age, that training was
of no use to him professionally, because,
as quickly as you can turn the palm of
your hand, Japan went through a wonderful
change from the old feudal régime
to the era of new civilization. So my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
father, and many, many others like him,
were just in mid-air, so to speak, being
thrown out of their proper sphere, but
unable to settle as yet to the solid ground
and adapt themselves to new ways. My
mother came also of the samurai stock,
and, like most of her class, kept in her
cabinet a small sword beautifully ornamented
in gold work, with which she was
ready to defend her honor whenever
obliged to. But far from being mannish,
she was as meek as a lamb, and was devoted
to my father and her children. My
grandmother was of a retiring nature and
I cannot draw her very much into my
narrative. But she was very good to
everybody, and her daily work, so far as
I can remember, was to take a walk around
the farm every morning. She was so
regular in this habit that I cannot think of
her without associating her with the scent
of the dewy morning and with the green
of the field which stretched before her.
She died not many years after, but I often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
wonder if she is really dead. To me she
is still living, and what the great poet said
of Lucy Gray sounds peculiarly true in her
case, too.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indent">That whistles in the wind.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Only you would have to make Lucy seventy
years old to fit my grandmother.</p>

<p>The introduction being over, let us
attend a dinner, or rather give attention
to a description of one. We do not eat
at one large dining-table with chairs
around it. We each have a separate small
table about a foot and a half square, all
lacquered red, green, or black, and sit before
it on our heels. A rice bucket, a teapot,
some saucers, a bottle of soy, and so
forth, are all placed near some one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
is to specially serve us. We used to sit in
two rows, father and grandmother facing
each other, mother next to father, with the
young sister opposite my brother and myself.
The younger children usually sit
next to some older person who can help
them in eating. No grace was said, but I
always bowed to my elders before I began
with &#8220;itadakimasu&#8221; (I take this with
thanks), which I sometimes said when I
was very hungry, as a good excuse and
signal to start eating before the others.</p>

<p>Rice is our staple food and an almost
reverential attitude toward it as the sustainer
of our life is entertained by the
people. And I was told time and again
not to waste it. Once a maid, so my
mother used to tell me, was very careless
in cleaning rice before it was cooked.
She dropped lots of grains on the stone
floor under the sink day after day, and
never stopped to pick them up. One day,
when she wanted to clean the floor, she
was frightened half to death by finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
there ever so many white serpents straining
their necks at her. She really fainted
when the goddess of the kitchen appeared
to her in her trance and bade her to take
all those white serpents in a basket and
wash them clean. As she came to herself,
she did as she was told, trembling
with horror at touching such vile things,
some of which, indeed, would try to coil
themselves around her hands. But as the
last pailful of water was poured on them,
lo! what were serpents a moment ago
were now all turned into nice grains of
rice ready to be boiled. Now if there is
one thing in the world I hate, it is a serpent;
the mere mention of it makes my
flesh creep. So you see I took care to
pitch every grain of boiled rice into my
mouth with my chop-sticks before I left my
table.</p>

<p>Another story was told me concerning
the meal. The Japanese teach home discipline
by stories, you know. This was
a short one, being merely the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
that if anybody lies down on the floor soon
after he has eaten his meal, he will turn
into a cow. Now a number of times I had
found cows chewing their cuds while
stretched upon the ground. So I thought,
in my childish mind, that there must be
some mysterious connection between each
of the three in the order as they stand:
eating&mdash;lying down&mdash;cow. So, naturally,
I avoided the second process, and,
after eating, immediately ran out-of-doors
to see what our man, Kichi, was doing.</p>

<p>Kichi worked on our little farm, and I
usually found him cleaning his implements
after the day&#8217;s work. We were
great friends, and he used to present me
with toys of his own making, which were
very simple but indeed a marvel to me.
Once he picked up a piece of bamboo and
made a chip of it about a twelfth of an
inch thick, a third of an inch wide, and
three inches and a half long. Then he
sliced obliquely one-half of one side and
the other half of the same side in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
opposite direction, so that the edges might
be made thin. He also bored a small hole
in the middle and put in a stick about
twice as thick as a hairpin and about four
inches long, the sliced side being down.
He then cut off the projecting end of the
stick, when it was tight in the chip. The
dragon-fly was now ready to take flight.
He took the stick between his palms and
gave a twist, when lo! it flew away up in
the air.</p>

<p>I was delighted with the toy, and tried
several times to make it fly. But when I
used all my force and gave it a good long
twist, why, it took such a successful flight
that it hit the edge of the comb of our
straw roof and stuck there, never to come
down. I was very sorry at that, but Kichi
laughed at the feat the dragon-fly had performed,
and said that the maker was so
skilful that the toy turned out to be a real
living thing! It was perched there for the
night. Well, I admired his skill very
much, but did not want to lose my toy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that way. So I made him promise me to
make another the next day, reminding him
not to put too much skill in it.</p>

<p>It was summer, the season of watermelons.
We had a small melon patch and
an ample supply of the fruit. Here was a
chance for Kichi to try his skill again.
One evening he took a pretty round melon
and scooped the inside out so as to put
in a lighted candle. So far this was very
ordinary. He scraped the inner part until
the rind was fairly transparent, and then
cut a mouth, a nose, and eyes with eyebrows
sticking out like pins. He then
painted them so that when the candle was
lighted a monster of a melon was produced.
How triumphant a boy would feel
in possessing such a thing! I hung it on
the veranda that evening when the room
was weirdly lighted by one or two greenish
paper lanterns, and watched it with my
folks. I expressed my admiration for
Kichi&#8217;s skill, and with boyish fondness for
exaggeration mentioned the fact that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
toy dragon-fly of his making had really
turned out to be a living thing. All
laughed, but of course I made an effort to
be serious. But no sooner were we silent
than, without the slightest hint, the melon
angrily dropped down with a crash. I
screamed, but, being assured of its safety,
I approached it and found the skull of the
monster was badly fractured, in fact, one
piece of it flying some twenty feet out in
the garden. The next morning I took the
first opportunity to tell Kichi that his toy
was so skilfully made that it sought death
of its own accord.</p>

<p>Well, I started to tell what I did evenings,
but when it was wet I had a very
tedious time. Nothing is more dismal to a
boy than a rainy day. To lie down was to
become a cow. So one rainy evening I
opened the screen, and, standing, looked
out at the rain. But this was no fun. The
only alternative was to go to one of the
rooms. Now there is no chair in a Japanese
house, and to sit over one&#8217;s heels is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
too ceremonial, not to say a bit trying, even
for a Japanese child. So my legs unconsciously
collapsed, and there I was lying
on my back, singing aloud some songs I
had learned. Presently I began to look
at the unpainted ceiling, and traced the
grain. And is it not wonderful that out
of knots and veins of wood you can make
figures of some living things? Yes, I
traced a man&#8217;s face, one eye much larger
than the other. Then, I had a cat. Now
I began to trace a big one with a V-shaped
face. A cow! The idea ran through me
with the swiftness of lightning, and the
next moment I sprang to my feet and
shook myself to see if I had undergone
any transformation. Luckily, I was all
right. But to make the thing sure, I felt
of my forehead carefully to see if anything
hard was coming out of it.</p>

<p>The room now lost its attraction. And
I ran away to the room where my grandmother
was. Opening the screen, I said:</p>


<p>&#8220;Grandma!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Bô?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come in? I want you to tell
me the story of a badger, grandma.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was never tired of hearing the same
stories over and over again from my
grandmother. There was at some distance
a tall tree, shooting up like an arrow
to the sky, which was visible from a window
of her room. It was there that the
badger of her story liked to climb. One
early evening he was there with the cover
of an iron pot, which he made with his
magic power appear like a misty moon.
Now a farmer, who was still working in
the field, chanced to see it, and was surprised
to find that it was already so late.
He could tell the hour from the position
of the moon, you know. So he made haste
to finish his work, and was going home,
when another moon, the real one this time,
peeped out of the wood near by. The
badger, however, had too much faith in his
art to withdraw his mock moon, and held
it there to rival the newly risen one. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
farmer was astonished to find two moons
at the same time, but he was not slow to
see which was real. He smiled at the
trick of the badger, and now wanted to
outwit him. He approached the tree
stealthily and shook it with all his might.
The badger was not prepared for this.
Losing his balance, he dropped down to the
ground, moon and all, and had to run for
his life, for the farmer was right after
him with his hoe.</p>

<p>I laughed and grandma laughed, too,
over her own story, when the paper screen
was suddenly brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;The badger&#8217;s moon!&#8221; I cried, and
climbed up to my grandmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am a badger,&#8221; said a voice, as
the door was opened. And there stood
my mother with a paper lantern she had
brought for the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the age of six I was sent to school.
For some time before the fall opening,
I was filled with excitement and curiosity
and looked forward to the day with great
impatience. As our neighbors were few
and scattered and I did not have many
playmates, I wondered how I should feel
on coming in contact with so many boys,
most of whom were older than I. And
then there was study. I had a faint idea
what a learned scholar such as Confucius
was, and felt as if a plunge into school a
day or two would half convert me into that
obscure ideal. Weeks before, I insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on having a mimic school at home to prepare
myself a little for the august event,
and with my mother as teacher I learned
the numerals and the forty-eight letters
of the Japanese alphabet by heart. I
wished to do just as I would at school, and
so I used to go outdoors and with measured
steps approach the porch. Entering
the house, I sat down before a table and
bowed reverentially. When my mother
was there before me, I cheerfully began to
study, well, for five minutes or so, but when
I found her not quite ready I was mercilessly
thrown out of humor, and only her
exaggerated bows for apology would induce
me to dry my sorrowful tears.</p>

<p>The few days before the opening of the
school were taken for my preparation. I
needed copy-books, a slate, an abacus,
which is a frame strung with wires on
which are wooden beads to be moved in
counting and reckoning, and a small writing-box,
containing a stone ink-well, a cake
of India ink, a china water-vessel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
brushes. I must have also a round lunch
set, the three pieces of which can be piled
one upon another like a miniature pagoda,
and then, when empty, be put one within
another to reduce the size. A pair of
chop-sticks went with the set of course.
Now all must be purchased new as if
everything had a new start. And then a
new school suit was procured together
with a navy cap. These were all ready a
day before, and were exhibited on the
alcove.</p>

<p>My younger brother was possessed of
the school mania at the sight of these last,
and insisted that he would have his set,
too. And so mimic ones were procured,
and these formed a second row together
with his holiday suit.</p>

<p>And then came the night before I was to
go. I played the part of a watch-dog by
sleeping right near my property. In fact,
I went to bed early, but I could not sleep
till after everybody had retired for the
night. And then I dreamed that my abacus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
stood up, its beads chattering on how to
start the trip in the morning. It was
joined by the copy-book, made of soft,
Japanese paper, which parted hither and
thither in walking, as a lady&#8217;s skirt,&mdash;a
Japanese lady&#8217;s, I mean. The chairman
was my navy cap. I did not know how
they decided, but they must have come to
a peaceful agreement, as they were found,
when I awoke in the morning, exactly in
the same place, lying quiet.</p>

<p>The next morning I set out with my
father for the school. The faces of every
one in the house were at the door looking
at me. I made every effort to be dignified
in walking, but could not help looking back
just once, when my face relaxed into a
smile, and I felt suddenly very shy. But
as I heard my younger brother struggling
to get away from my mother to follow me,
I hastened my steps to turn round a corner
of the road.</p>

<p>The school was a low, dark-looking
building, with paper-screened windows all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
around like a broad white belt, and with a
spacious porch with dusty shelves to leave
clogs on. When we arrived, we were led
into a side room, where we met the master
or principal, and soon my father returned
home, leaving me to his care. I felt somewhat
lonesome with strangers all around,
but kept myself as cool as possible, which
effort was very much like stopping a leak
with the hands. A slight neglect would
bring something misty into my eyes. But
now all the boys&mdash;and girls, too, in the
other room&mdash;came into one large room.
Some forty of the older ones and fifteen
of those who had newly entered took their
seats, the older ones glancing curiously at
the newcomers. But we were all in back
seats and so were not annoyed with looks
that would have been felt piercing us from
behind. The desk I was assigned to was a
miserable one; not only was it besmeared
with ink ages old, but cuts were made here
and there as if it were a well-fought battleground.
But I did not feel ashamed to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
there, as I thought that this was a kind of
place in which a Confucius was to be
brought up.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_040f.jpg" alt="A Japanese School Scene" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Japanese School Scene.</span></p>

<p>Looking awhile on what was going on,
I found the boys were divided into three
classes. The method of teaching was
curious; one class alone was allowed to
have a reading lesson, while the other two
were having writing or arithmetic, that is,
the teaching was so arranged that what
one class was doing might not disturb the
others. I was struck, even in my boyish
mind, with the happy method, and learned
the first lesson in management. And then
reading was done partly in unison with
the master, in a singsong style, and the
effect was pleasing, if it was not very loud.
The class in arithmetic, on the other hand,
sent out a pattering noise of pencils on the
slates, which in a confused mass would
form an overtone of the orchestra. A
writing lesson taken in the midst of such
a company was never tiresome. Indeed,
anything out of tune would send the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
house into laughter, and such things were
constantly happening.</p>




<p>I was not slow in becoming acquainted
with the boys. As I went into the playground
for the first time, I felt rather
awkward to find nobody to play with.
But soon two boys whom I knew thrust
themselves before me and uncovered
their heads. And from that moment the
playground became a place of great interest
to me. Two friends grew into five,
eight, ten, and fifteen, and in three days
I felt as if I possessed the whole ground.</p>

<p>As things grew more familiar, I found
almost every boy was striving a little bit
to be out of tune. When singsong reading
was going on, pupils echoing responsively
the teacher&#8217;s voice, some wild boy would
suddenly redouble his effort with gusto,
and his voice, like that of a strangled
chicken, would soar away up, to the great
merriment of the rest. And then often a
boy, whose mind was occupied with a hundred
and one things except the book, engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in some sly communication with
another, unconscious of the teacher&#8217;s approach,
when he would literally jump into
the air as the master&#8217;s whip descended
sharply on his desk. We sat by twos on
benches, and when one boy saw his companion
carelessly perching on the end of
the bench, just right for experimenting
the principle of the lever, he would not
miss a moment to stand up, presumably
to ask some question. But no sooner had
he called to the teacher, than the other fellow
would shoot down to the floor with a
cry, and the bench come back with a tremendous
noise. But this was not all.
When the boys could not find a pretense to
make a noise, they would stealthily paint
their faces with writing brushes. Two
touches would be enough to grow a thick
mustache curling up to the ears. When
the teacher faced a dozen of those mustache-wearing
boys who were unable to
efface their naughty acts as quickly as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
had committed them, he could do nothing
but to burst into undignified laughter.</p>

<p>One day a strange method of discipline
was instituted. The teacher must have
been at a loss to bring the urchins to behave
well. It was the last hour, the only
hour, I think, the boys kept quiet. They
did so partly because the course bore the
great name of ethics, but more because
moral stories were told. And the boys
did not care whether the stories were moral
or not, as long as they were interesting.
Here is one of the twenty-four Chinese
stories that teach filial duty:</p>

<p>There was once a boy by the name of
Ching who had an old mother. He was a
good boy, and did what he could to please
her. The mother, however, often asked for
things hard to get. One day in winter she
wanted some carp for her dinner. It was
very cold, and the lake where Ching used
to fish was all frozen. What could he do?
He, however, went to the lake, looked about
the place to find out where the ice was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
thick, and, baring himself about his stomach,
lay flat to thaw it. It was a very difficult
thing to do, but at last the ice gave
way, and to his great joy, from the crevice
thus made, a big carp jumped out into the
air. So he could satisfy his mother&#8217;s
want.</p>

<p>Not only the boys who listened intently,
but also the teacher, got interested as the
story grew to the climax, and the latter
would gesticulate and eventually impersonate
the dutiful boy, showing surprise
at seeing a carp jumping ten feet into the
air. This called forth laughter which was
meant for applause. But the teacher soon
came to himself and called silence. One
day, after telling this story, he said that
it was yet half an hour before the time to
close, but he would dismiss us. &#8220;But,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;you can go only one by
one, beginning with those who are quiet
and good. This is to train you for your
orderly conduct in study-hours, and if any
one cannot keep quiet, even for half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
hour, he shall stay in his place till he can
do so.&#8221; This was a severe test. An early
dismissal, even of five minutes before the
time, had a special charm for boys, but
to-day we could march out half an hour
earlier. And then what a lovely day it
was in autumn! The warm sun was
bright, and the trees were ablaze with
golden leaves. Persimmons were waiting
for us to climb up and feast on them.
After a moment the boys were as still as
night. One by one a &#8220;good&#8221; boy was
called to leave; they went like lambs to
the door, but no sooner were they out,
than some stamped on the stairs noisily
and shouted and laughed on the green,
which act showed that the teacher did not
always pick the right ones. I naturally
waited my turn with impatience. I thought
I was a pretty good boy. At least I had
Confucius for my ideal, and those who had
it were not many. I never did mischief,
except once, and that was really an accident.
I dropped my lunch-box in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
arithmetic class, and chased it, as it had
rolled off quite a distance. Half the school
laughed at me, and that was all. I was now
musing on my ill-luck when a call came to
me at last. It was still a quarter of an
hour before closing time, and I thought the
teacher knew me, after all.</p>

<p>Within a month after I entered the
school, I made a new discovery as to a
schoolboy&#8217;s equipments. I had thought
that they consisted only of books, copy-books,
an abacus, and such things. But
these form only a half of them. The
other half are hidden to view: they are
in the pockets, or in the sleeves, I should
have said. During the recess a strong
cord will come out and also a top about
two and a half inches in diameter, and
with an iron ring a quarter of an inch
thick. A Japanese top is a mad thing.
When it sings out of the hands and hits
that of the opponent, sending it off
crippled, it makes you feel very happy.
Another thing is a sling. It is as old as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
time of David, but it was perfectly new
to me. When a pebble shoots out and
vanishes in the air, you feel as though you
were able to hit a kite circling away up in
the sky. And another thing! It is a
knife, the broad-bladed one. With it they
cut a piece one and a half feet long out of
a thick branch of a tree and sharpen one
end of it. Selecting a piece of soft ground,
the boys in turn drive in their own pieces
and try to knock over the others. The
game depends much on one&#8217;s strength and
the kind of wood one selects. But there
is a pleasure in possessing a cruel branch
that will knock off three or four pieces at
a blow. Oh, for a knife and a top! I
thought. I disclosed the matter to my
mother, who thought a top was all right
and bought me one. But as for the knife,
she gave me a small one, fit only to sharpen
a pencil with. I felt ashamed (I blush to
confess, though) even to show it to my
schoolmates. If I had had money, I would
have given my all just for a knife. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
money was a mean thing; the possession
of it was the root of all evil&mdash;so it was
thought, and, indeed, I was penniless.
But I must have a decent knife&mdash;decent
among boys. If I could only get one I
would give my Confucius for it.</p>

<p>One day I saw my Kichi&mdash;we had kept
up our meeting ever since. I talked to
him about a knife. He did not tell me how
I could get one because I talked only about
what the possession of a good knife would
mean to a boy. It was a rather general
remark, but I disliked to go right to the
point. It would be too much to presume
on his kindness, you know. And then I
rather wanted him to offer. He, however,
produced his own favorite knife and cut
a thick piece of deal right away to show
how sharp it was. Well, I thought he had
a knife sense, anyway. So I kept talking
about it day after day, and each time I
talked of it he showed me his, and tried it
on a piece of wood.</p>

<p>One day there was a town festival and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in the evening I was allowed to go with
Kichi to see it. Kichi&#8217;s manner that night
was very strange; he appeared as if he
had a chestful of gold. He asked me in
a fatherly manner what I liked, and said
he could buy me all the booths if I wished
him to. I never felt so happy as then. I
thought my patience had conquered him
at last. And to make a long story short,
I came to own a splendid knife, better
than any other boy&#8217;s at the school! That
night I slept with it under the pillow.</p>

<p>The next morning the first thing I did
was to go to thank Kichi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Kichi,&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Thank
you very much for the knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good morning, Bot&#8217;chan. Let me
see your knife,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I am
sorry that I played a joke on you last
night. It was your mother who paid for
it. You must go and thank her for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never!&#8221; I gasped. But being
told how she handed him the money when
we started, I gave him a slap&mdash;a mild one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
though&mdash;on his face and ran immediately
to my mother, thinking that after all she
had something more than a mere knife
sense.</p>

IN TOKYO</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Where We Settled&mdash;A Police Stand&mdash;Stores&mdash;&#8220;Broadway&#8221;&mdash;Illumination&mdash;The
Foreign Settlement.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two years after I entered the village
school I had to leave it for good and all.
My father, as I have said, was in mid-air
between the heaven of old Japan and the
prosaic earth of the new institution. He
would fain have remained there, had he
had a pillar of gold to support him. And
it is wonderful to see how this glittering
pillar does support one in almost any
place. It was a very serious matter for
him to launch in the new current without
any helpful equipment. But he had to do
it, and made up his mind to try his fortune
at the very centre of the new civilization,
Tokyo. And so one day we said good-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to our friends who came to see us off, and
started for the capital. &#8220;Parting is such
sweet sorrow,&#8221; as the poet sang, but I
hardly remember now whether I shed tears
or not. As I, however, look back to the
day, I cannot but be grateful for the new
move, for the immeasurable benefit it
brought at least to us children.</p>

<p>In Tokyo we settled very near where my
aunt lived. The street was by no means
in a noisy quarter, but I can hardly think
of anywhere in the city which was so well
situated for being in contact with so many
places of interest, at least for a boy just
from the country. It was near to the
&#8220;Broadway&#8221; of Tokyo, and just as near
to the foreign settlement and to the railroad
station, the only one of the kind in
the city in those days. And if I wanted a
touch of the old order of things, there was
a big temple, a block on the east, which
made its presence known to the forgetful
people by striking a big bell every evening.
I cannot say they rang the bell, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the bells at Buddhist temples do not
chime, but boom. They are so big&mdash;bigger
than a siege-gun. I liked the
sound very much, as it brought to me like
a dream the vision of a hillside sleeping
under the setting sun. But I must not
forget to mention a large piece of grassy
ground very near us, where we could
romp, fly kites, or play at a tug-of-war.</p>

<p>Now the first thing I did when I came
to the new place was to familiarize myself
with the neighborhood for the sake of
running errands, or just to keep myself
informed. First I started eastward and
turned the corner to the left, where I found
a wee bit of a house, or rather a box, six
feet by nine, where two policemen were
stationed. It was the first time I had ever
seen any of them, and I thought they were
a queer sort of people, who looked at me
suspiciously whenever I looked at them
in that way. But I thought as long as I
did not do anything wrong, they would
have no reason for coming at me. I also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
had great faith that if a thief should break
into our house, they would soon come to
our help. So I made several trials to
see how quickly I could cover the distance
to give them notice. They must have
thought me a strange boy as I came panting
to the police stand and stopped short
to look at the clock inside.</p>

<p>A little beyond began the market. First
a grocery store, then a fish stall, a bean-cake
shop, and so on. I remember that
the house I most frequented was a sweet
potato store. I could get five or six nice
hot baked pieces for a penny. And how I
liked them! At regular intervals fresh
ones were ready and we waited for them,
falling into a line. When we got as much
as we wanted, we would run a race lest
they should get too cold. At the end of the
street, just opposite a tall fire-ladder,
standing erect and with a bell on the top,
was a big meat store. Beef, pork, everything,
they had, and sometimes I found a
bill posted saying, &#8220;Mountain Whale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
To-day.&#8221; Whatever that might be, I
never cared to eat such doubtful things.
You never tried sea-horse or sea-elephant,
did you?</p>

<p>Then, going in another direction from
my house, I made my way to &#8220;Broadway.&#8221;
I first crossed a bridge which
spanned a canal and came to an object of
much interest. It was a telegraph-pole.
I was never able to count the wires on it
unless I did it by the help of a multiplication
table, as there were so many of them,
coming from all parts of the country to
the central station. A strange thing about
them was that they sang. When I put my
ear to the pole, even on a windless day, I
could hear a number of soft voices wailing,
as it were. I thought they must come
from messages running on the wires, many
of which were indeed too sad to describe.
And then there was something which made
me think that boys in that vicinity had a
very hard time. Many a time I saw kites
with warriors&#8217; faces painted on them, entangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in the wires. The faces which
looked heroic, now seemed only grinning
furiously for agony! But I must not be
musing on such things, for if I did not
take care in that crowded thoroughfare, a
jinrikisha man would come dashing from
behind with &#8220;Heigh, there!&#8221; which took
the breath out of a country boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_056f.jpg" alt="The Japanese Broadway" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Japanese &#8220;Broadway.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Broadway was built after a foreign
style,&mdash;I don&#8217;t know which country&#8217;s,
though. There were sidewalks with willow-trees,&mdash;and
there are no sidewalks in
ordinary Japanese roads,&mdash;and brick
houses, two stories high, and with no basement.
Horse-cars were running, but they
would not be on the track after ten in the
evening. Many jinrikishas were running,
too, and some half a dozen of them were
waiting for customers at each corner. But
not a shadow of a cab was to be seen anywhere.
To tell the truth, I never thought
of finding one then, its existence in the
world being unknown to me at that time.
There were a good many wonders in store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
for me in the shops, and I never grew tired
of inspecting them. One curious thing
was that here and there at the notion
stores boys were playing hand-organs,
probably to draw customers in. So I
thought, anyway, and every time I passed
I obliged them awhile by listening to their
music. As I strolled on, I came across a
sign with &#8220;Shiruko&#8221; in large letters on
it. Shiruko is a sort of pudding, made of
sweet bean sauce and rice dumpling, and
served hot. To be sure, it made my mouth
water, but I went on reading a bill over
the wall. There were twelve varieties of
shiruko, it said, styled after the names of
the months, and any one who could finish
eating all of them at one time, would get
a prize besides the return of the price!
How I wished that I had a big stomach!</p>

<p>The sight of Broadway was prettier in
the evening, when the sidewalks would be
lined with hundreds of stalls. I shall have
occasion to describe them later, and so
let me now mention one thing which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
never remember without a smile. It was
an illumination on a holiday evening&mdash;not
of the whole street, but of only one
building, and that of two stories, I remember.
It was a newspaper office. And
as newspapers are always giving us something
new, this building, I think, awoke
one morning to give us what was very new
at that time. It girdled itself just once
with an iron pipe half an inch in diameter,
which twisted itself into some characters
in the front, and awaited a holiday evening.
The paper advertised that everybody
should come to see how they were
going to celebrate the holiday evening.
So the whole city turned out, and all my
folks, too. Hand-organs in the stores
around began a concert, and people waited
with their mouths open. The time came,
and lights were seen running from both
ends like serpents, closing up in the centre.
Wonder of wonders! &#8220;DAILY NEWS
OFFICE&#8221; in gaslight appeared!</p>

<p>I must tell you one more adventure I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
had, and that was an excursion into the
foreign settlement. As I came to the city
I met with a foreigner once in a while. I
wondered how I should feel if I but
plunged into their crowd and spoke with
them, if possible. So one day, with a
curious mind, I started for the place where
the foreigners lived together, about a mile
from my home. As I neared the settlement
I made several discoveries. First,
the houses looked very prim and square,
straight up and down, painted white, or
in some light color. When viewed from a
distance they looked as if they were so
many gravestones in a temple yard. Unfortunately,
it was the only comparison
that occurred to a country boy. As I
looked again, I found out another fact.
That was, that while Japanese houses were
nestling under the trees, foreign houses
were above them. In fact, there was nothing
more than low bushes around the
houses. So my conclusion was that foreigners
lived in gravestone-like houses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
did not like tall trees, being tall themselves,
perhaps. As I entered a street I
found everything just contrary to my expectation.
Streets were deserted instead
of being thronged; only one or two people
and a dog were seen crossing. I went on,
when, as luck would have it, I neared a
Catholic temple from which two men, or
women,&mdash;I could not distinguish which,&mdash;dressed
in black, with hoods of the same
color, came! How dismal, I thought, and
immediately took to my heels till I came
to another part of the street where the
houses faced the sea. I wanted to see a
boy or a girl, anyway, if I could not find
a crowd. As I looked I saw something
white at one of the gates, and what was
my delight when I found it to be a little
girl! I approached her, but not very near,
as we could not talk to each other. I just
kept at an admiring distance. I stood
there, one eye on her and the other on the
sea, lest I should drive her in by looking
at her with both my eyes, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
examine her. What a pretty creature she
was! With her face white as a lily and
her cheeks pink as a cherry flower, she
stood there watching me. Her light hair
was parted, a blue ribbon being tied on
one side like a butterfly. She had on a
white muslin dress with a belt to match the
ribbon, but what was my astonishment to
find that I could not see any dress beyond
her knees! I could not believe it at first,
but the dress stopped short there, and the
slender legs, covered with something
black,&mdash;I did not care what,&mdash;were shooting
out. Might not some malicious person
have cut it so? &#8220;Oh, please, for mercy&#8217;s
sake, cover them,&#8221; was my thought. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care if you have a long dress, the
skirt trailing on the ground.&#8221; But was I
mistaken in my standard of criticism?
I looked at myself, and, sure enough, my
kimono reached down to my feet!</p>

MY NEW SCHOOL</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Tomo-chan&mdash;The Men with Wens&mdash;A Curious Punishment&mdash;How
I Experienced It&mdash;Kotoro-kotoro.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course I attended another school as
soon as we were settled. And every morning
I went with my Tomo-chan.</p>

<p>But I must tell you who Tomo-chan was.
She&mdash;yes, <i>she</i>&mdash;was the adopted daughter
of my aunt, of about the same age as
I, and in the same class at school. I wish
I had space enough to tell you how she
came to be adopted, but I shall have to be
contented just with telling you that the
main cause of her becoming a member of
my aunt&#8217;s family was all through me.
Aunty had no child, but she had found how
lovely a child is, even if he be mischievous,
through my short visit two years before,
which I have had no occasion to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
you about. Now one of the first principles
in physics says that nature abhors a
vacuum. This means that it is unnatural
for a place to have nothing in it. I had
gone back: who was to fill my place? So
Tomo-chan, a better and certainly prettier
child than I, slipped into my shoes.</p>

<p>Aunty wished us to be good friends. So
I called on her every morning on my way
to school, and in the afternoon we went
over our lesson together. Arithmetic was
not very hard for me, and so I helped her
over pitfalls of calculation, while she did
the same for me with reading. Girls remember
very well, but do not care to reason
things out, it seems. And indeed,
Tomo-chan remembered even the number
of mistakes I made in reading. Now what
one can do in half a day, two can accomplish
in half an hour, was the philosophy
that came to me from our case; for our
drudgery was over in no time, and we were
going through Tomo-chan&#8217;s treasure of
nice pictures and books of fairy-tales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
There was a picture in one of the books
of an old man with a wen on his cheek,
dancing before a crowd of demons and
goblins. &#8220;Look here, what is this?&#8221; I
asked. She laughed at the picture and
would not tell me about it till she had
thoroughly enjoyed laughing. That is
the way of a girl. But with &#8220;O dear!&#8221;
she started thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;One day, this old man with a wen happened
to fall into a crowd of those ugly
monsters, and was made to dance. He
danced very well, and so was asked to come
again the next day. The goblins wanted
something for a pledge for his keeping
his word and so removed the wen from the
man&#8217;s cheek. The old man was very glad
to part with it, and went home, when he
met another man with a wen.&#8221; She
turned the leaf to show another picture.
This time the new man was dancing before
the weird crowd. &#8220;You see, this man
was told how he could remove his wen,
and is now showing his skill before them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
induce them to ask for the pledge. But
he did not have any practice at all in dancing
and so was just jumping round.
And the goblins got angry over his deceit,
and sent him back with the wen that the
old man had left.&#8221; Turning the leaf,
&#8220;Here he is with wens on both his
cheeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed again, and I could not help
laughing with her, too. At this moment
some one was coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, is this the way you study your
lesson?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was aunty who entered the room
as she said: &#8220;I am surprised at you.&#8221;
And she laid down a tray with a teapot and
cups and a dish of cakes on it. The sight
made us happy all at once, and Tomo-chan
explained to her how soon we had finished
our study.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Ei-chan helped me in arithmetic,
so we finished a long, long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ei-chan is a good boy, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
said aunty. Boys feel awkward to be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
spoken of to their face, and my speech
failed me somehow. By the way, I was
no longer &#8220;Bot&#8217;chan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The school I found much larger and
finer than the village one. The pupils
numbered ten times more. Each class had
its own room, and boys and girls marched
in and out in procession every hour. It
was so much more orderly and systematic
than the village school that there was less
of &#8220;out-of-tune&#8221; matter. But then there
was one thing that puzzled me. It was that
often a boy was seen standing in the hallway
with a bowl of water in his hands.
Sometimes he stood there motionless until
the class was all dismissed. But I was not
slow to divine the cause. What puzzled
me was the question: &#8220;How could that be
the best form of punishment?&#8221; While a
boy stood there he need not attend the
class. That was certainly easy for an idle
boy. And then there was no pain to endure.
As to the holding of a bowl, why,
did I not hold my bowl of rice every meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and not know even if it was heavy or
light? But another solution suggested itself
to me; it might have the same effect
on the offender as wearing a cap with &#8220;I
am a Fool,&#8221; written on it. He stood there,
and everybody thought he was a bad boy.
&#8220;It might be, it might be,&#8221; I said, congratulating
myself on the happy solution,
when a crow that had just alighted on a
branch of the elm by the gate repeated,
&#8220;It might be!&#8221; I threw a stone at him
without thinking that it was a violation
of the school rule, and, if discovered, I
might have undergone the punishment.</p>

<p>At any rate, I was destined, it appeared,
to undergo the punishment once at least.
And it happened in this way.</p>

<p>At this school, boys were not allowed to
carry iron tops or even hand-balls. There
were too many of them, and if they should
all indulge in these sports, there would be
constant danger of breaking their legs or
knocking their noses off. So comparatively
harmless footballs were provided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Now, one noon recess, ten of us wanted to
have a game. We were divided into
parties of five and played. Of course we
had no rules to go by, but tried to carry
the ball within the enemy&#8217;s lines by
every means. One time we fumbled furiously
near the building, and, in the heat of
our tackling, one fellow seized the ball and
kicked it without minding in which direction
he was aiming. If he had had less
skill the ball would have gone only over
the roof and dropped on the head of a
jinrikisha man running on the other street.
But as it was, it went madly against a
window-pane and smashed it all to pieces.
What a noise it made! For a minute it
made all the boys and girls playing on the
ground keep quite still. And in this awful
suspense a teacher appeared and caught
the five, I among the number, who were
still in the position of fumbling, together
with the poor fellow who did the kicking,
and who stood dazed, unable to recover
as yet from the shock of his late experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
I didn&#8217;t know how the other four escaped
being caught, but I was glad that they
did.</p>

<p>There was no question in the teacher&#8217;s
mind but that all six should be exhibited
in the hallway, and so we were made to
stand there, each holding a bowl of water.
Now I had an ample opportunity to learn
every significance of this form of punishment.
Naturally, we felt merry at first.
In the first place, there was something unreasonable
and ludicrous in the way at
least five of us came to stand there. And
then when you have companions in your
bad luck, you feel surely light of heart.
And so we did. But when fifteen, thirty
minutes passed, our legs got to be stiff
and the weightless bowls began to weigh
very much in our hands. Indeed, the
slightest inclination would spill the water!
But why did we not drink some of it, you
may say? Well, we should have done it,
but we knew that it must all be there when
the teacher came. Forty-five minutes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the bell rang for the dismissal. All the
boys and girls poured out, leaving us alone.
Ah, that is the saddest moment for any
schoolboy, for after that the school is dismal
as a prison. Fifteen minutes more,
and all the teachers, except the one in
charge of us, were gone. None of us dared
to look up, our heads being bent with extreme
sorrow. Presently a weak-minded
fellow dropped his china and cried out.
It was not I, but we were all ready to follow
his example, when the teacher came
out, and, removing the bowls, read us a
lecture before sending us home.</p>

<p>We lost our courage, even to run out of
the school compound, but dragged slowly
home. But when I turned the first corner
whom should I meet but my Tomo-chan?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Tomo-chan!&#8221; I looked at her
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not go home without you. So
I waited for you. But isn&#8217;t it a shame
for teacher to punish you without your
deserving it?&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>&#8220;We did not want to let Takeda suffer
alone, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>My answer was a surprise even to me.
Of course, I did not think to the contrary,
but I was not impressed with the significance
of it till I put it into words and&mdash;to
her. It came as a new thought to me.
Our hearts became light, the thing was forgotten,
and only the prospect of the fine
time we should have that golden afternoon
in late summer occupied our minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to
the field!&#8221;</p>

<p>And we hastened on briskly, and, throwing
our things into our houses on the way,
went to the field, green with cool, cushion-like
grass. About a dozen boys and girls
were already waiting for us, and we just
jumped among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we play?&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have Kotoro-kotoro,&#8221; suggested
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fun!&#8221; all shouted.</p>

<p>To play the game, we must first select<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
from the boys one &#8220;chief&#8221; to protect his
&#8220;sons and daughters,&#8221; and one &#8220;imp&#8221;
to catch them. The boys stand in a circle
and are ready to say &#8220;Jan-ken-pon,&#8221; and
to hammer with their fists. At &#8220;pon&#8221;
you make one of three shapes with your
hand. When your hand is spread, that
denotes a sheet of paper; when two fingers
only are stretched, that means a pair
of scissors; and when your hand is held
closed, it signifies a stone. A sheet of
paper can be cut by scissors, but the latter
is ineffectual on a stone. But a stone can
be wrapped by a sheet of paper. Hence,
each one can defeat one of the rest, but is
conquered by the other. To simplify the
matter, you can use only two of the three
shapes. The one who wins at first is to be
the chief, the one who is ultimately defeated,
the imp. So we began: &#8220;Jan-ken-pon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Only three won. Then those three tried
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jan-ken-pon!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>I won; and so was the chief. The rest
went on jan-ken-ponning till the imp was
decided.</p>

<p>Now all except the imp held firmly each
other&#8217;s belt on the back, in a line, with me
at the head. It is a pity you don&#8217;t have
any belt on your dress, and so play the
sport. It is very convenient to us. Apart
from its use in sport, when we meet a robber,
we throw him down by jiu-jitsu, and,
untying our belt, bind him up hand and
foot! But to return. I was ready with the
imp in front and with my &#8220;little ones&#8221;
behind, like the body of a centipede. The
imp could not touch me; he could only
seize any one behind. I stretched my
arms, ran to and fro to prevent the imp
from getting round to my flanks. The
line swayed, rolled, jerked like a serpent
in a rapid flight. And the motion would
all but throw weak-armed ones off their
holds. But they merrily persisted, and
could have held on longer but for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mirth being worked up too high by the
very manner of the imp himself.</p>

<p>The boy who played that part was a
born comedian. He loved his fun more
than his bread. Once in the midst of his
supper he heard a man come with a monkey
dressed in a kimono. No sooner than he
recognized that by the sound of a drum,
he threw away his chop-sticks, and, running
out of his house, danced all way up
the street with the professional monkey as
his wondering spectator. Now in playing
his part as the imp, he did not go about it
like an eagle intent on his prey. But he
brought all his talent into full play in
every motion of his body, suggestive of
some grotesque form, heightened by a
queer ejaculation. When, in his series of
performances, he imitated a pig, flapping
his hands from his head like large ears
of the animal and grunting, Gr-r-r-r,
Gr-r-r-r, it caused everybody to burst into
laughter. At this moment he made a sudden
turn, which caused such a jerk to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
line, that, being absent-minded from merriment,
they were all thrown out of their
hold, each rolling on the grass, but still
laughing at the grunting. The imp could
now jump at anybody for his prey, but as a
true comedian, he also rolled on the grass,
laughing with the rest.</p>

CHINESE EDUCATION</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">My Chinese Teacher&mdash;How I Was Taught&mdash;Versification&mdash;My
Uncle&mdash;Clam Fishing&mdash;A Flatfish.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> months after I entered the public
school, my father came to a conclusion that
what was taught there was too modern to
have enough of culture value. My education
had to be supplemented by the study
of Chinese classics. And his intention
would have been of great benefit to me
if he had been equally wise in selecting a
good private teacher. As it was, I gained
but a fraction of it, undergoing a hard
struggle.</p>

<p>There lived a Chinese scholar near by,
who was second to none in his learning
within three miles. Formerly he was a
priest of Zen sect, the Unitarian of Buddhism.
As it was considered most laudable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to a man of his calling, he never ate fish
or meat, and had two frugal meals a day,
taking only a cupful of starch and sugar
in the evening, till he came to lead a secular
life. Starch and sugar!&mdash;so he must
have come to have such white hair, I
thought. Anyway, the snowy mass heightened
the expression of his earnest face,
rather youthful for a man of sixty. He
was, indeed, the classic itself; the rhythm
of it seemed to be ringing in his veins,
whether awake or asleep. And he delighted
in nothing so much as to eat his
dinner listening to the clear-voiced chanting
of boys reviewing their lesson, as if
they were minstrels entertaining at a
king&#8217;s feast! And, of course, I was sent
to him.</p>

<p>I started from the beginning, which was,
indeed, no beginning at all. The Chinese
sages did not write their scriptures as
graded school text-books, but their descendants
believed so, anyhow. Genesis
was the genesis of successful mastery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
And so I began with that great sentence
in the &#8220;Book of Great Learning:&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Learning is a gateway to virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>I envy those boys who tore Chinese authors,
and whose books, when taken to a
second-hand bookstore, were not bought
even for a penny. My books were, on the
contrary, just as clean as ever, as if they
had been too loath to impart anything to
the owner. And this was not from any
effort on my part to take care of them,
but simply from the little use I made
of them. Now this was the way I
studied them. Teacher would read with
me about four pages in advance, and
see once how I could read. I stuck;
he prompted me; I stuck again; he
prompted me again; I stuck for the
third time, and for the third time he
prompted me, and so on, and indeed continually,
if I had gone on till I had thoroughly
mastered it. But one review
seemed to him sufficient for such <i>easy</i> passages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and my boyish heart responded too
gladly to be released after a short lesson.
And I laid my book by till the next day.
I did not know how the teacher regarded
me, but he must have thought me a very
bright fellow for whom such a slow process
as review was totally unnecessary. And he
immediately took up the next four pages
and went on in the usual manner. The
first book was finished; the teacher&#8217;s instinct
asserted itself, and he wanted me to
read a few pages by way of a test before
I proceeded. What a shame! I only
recognized a box here and a starfish there,
and that was all. The teacher was angry
at the result. He saw that I was not prepared
yet to take up the classics. And
with his admirable pedagogical insight,
he sent me to a primer the very next day.
It was a Japanese history, written in easy
Chinese prose. How I enjoyed the change!
The passages rolled off on my tongue as
easily as you might say, &#8220;Mary had a
little lamb.&#8221; The teacher smiled at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
ease, and soon recovered his humor. But
his eyes were so constructed as to see nothing
but the top and the foot of a mountain,
and his mind worked like a spring-board,
which either stays low or jumps high up.
And on the third day I was ordered to
begin the second book of the classics, called
the &#8220;Doctrine of Mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I plodded on. I went through the
&#8220;Book of Divination,&#8221; and &#8220;Odes of
Spring and Autumn,&#8221; and came out only
with some phantoms of angular, mysterious
hieroglyphics dancing before my eyes.
But my Chinese education included something
more than reading. It was versification.
Just think of requiring a ten-year-old
boy to write verse in Latin or Greek.
But every Saturday I was required to do
the same sort of thing for two years. Oh,
how I struggled! I hunted for something
sensible to write, but while all sorts of
nonsense would come up, even common
sense, that most useful guide in a prosaic
field, fled from me. Outside, merry shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of boys&mdash;a happy group who cared for
balls and kites more than dry-as-dust
&#8220;culture&#8221;&mdash;were heard, and I mused in
a corner of a room, consulting such help
as a phrase book and a rhyming dictionary.
Nothing but doggerel could be born
of such a forced labor. Here is a specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Shut from the blue of skies in spring,</div>
<div class="indent">I sit and fret for words to rhyme.</div>
<div class="verse">O bird, if you have songs to sing,</div>
<div class="indent">Drop one for me to save my time!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Chinese training did me at least one
good turn. It drove Confucius out of my
head!</p>

<p>I should have been a blighted boy if
Sundays had not come to my rescue. The
real use to which the day should be put
had not dawned on me, nor was it in the
mind of those who introduced the institution.
But I am glad to say that it
did me good in many ways. With this,
however, my uncle is invariably associated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>I have not said anything about him, but
he was a well-fed man with a goat&#8217;s
beard. He was very nervous, however, and
could not keep from pulling his beard.
This accounted for its scantiness. It was
very amusing to observe how easily his
temper was disturbed out of its normal
mood. When he was contradicted he
pulled hard at his beard and wrung his
hands furiously. His body seemed to expand
with the inner fire when he ejaculated
many an &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; preliminary to
an eruption. Everybody had to find
shelter and thrust his fingers into his ears,
lest the drums should break. But when he
was pleased, his face melted with laughter;
he went to a cupboard to look for
some nice thing for us, ordered dinner to
be hurried for our sake, and went round
and round us to see if we were really comfortable.</p>

<p>He was very alert, and was always looking
for a new thing. He did well, too,
to keep himself abreast of the age, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
indeed, mastered something of the English
language, of which he could well boast
in his day. His pronunciation, however,
was rather painful to hear, and in
his talk with foreigners his nervous hands
played a large part to fill in the gaps in
his vocabulary, with an intermixture of
many a &#8220;you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>One good thing about him was his love
for outdoor sports. He could not sit all
day like my Chinese teacher, and if ever
an eruption occurred, it was always on
the occasion of such confinement to his
room. His Sundays were scheduled for
this or that kind of pleasure excursion.
And of course I was wise enough to do
what I could to please him in order that I
might not be left out of his party.</p>

<p>One Sunday we were to go clam-fishing.
When it was announced on Friday before,
I thought of a great time and could hardly
sleep for joy. After a tedious labor of
writing verse was over the next Saturday,
I busied myself the rest of the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with the preparation for the next day.
I kept going to my uncle&#8217;s to see whether
we had the same things that they had, and
also to suggest the necessity of providing
things we had and they had not. Many
conferences for this purpose were held at
the door-sill with Tomo-chan. Small hand-rakes
were bought, one for each; small and
large baskets, knives, thick-soled socks,
small sashes, and so forth, were collected
from various sources. To this I added
a net three by four feet large, with two
poles to meet the exigency of encountering
some large fish&mdash;perhaps a whale. But
of this I did not speak to anybody.</p>

<p>Mother was also busy preparing our
lunch. For this she got up very early in
the morning and boiled rice, which she
made into triangular, round, or square
masses, speckled with burned sesame
seeds. She packed them in several lacquered
boxes, with fresh pickles and
cooked vegetables. We relied on our
clams for chief dishes; so some cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
utensils were necessary. Also some tea
and a teapot, cups and dishes, together
with chop-sticks and toothpicks, even.</p>

<p>The day was not fair, but it was just the
kind of weather for the season, dull and
somewhat hazy, but bespeaking a calm sea.
The tide was fast ebbing when we started
in a boat. There was a good company of
us, including uncle, aunt, mother, Tomo-chan,
and me. As we emerged into the bay
from the canal, the extended view was
delightful. On one side green masses of
pine-trees overhung the stone mounds and
merged into a leafy hill, which stretched
itself like an arm into the sea. On the
other, beyond reedy shoals, the old forts,
with a lighthouse on one of them, dotted
the expanse. The view was washed in
gray, and even the sails of junks, hanging
lazily from the masts, were scarcely lighter
than the background.</p>

<p>All was calm. But as we sighted from
a distance some other parties already on
the scene, we soon forgot everything for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the excitement and let the boatman hurry
with all his strength. It was nine when
we arrived at the desired spot, and we
had three hours to enjoy ourselves. We
fixed our boat to a pole, from the top of
which was drooping a piece of red and
white cloth. This served as our mark to
enable us to find the boat quickly in the
case of need. So each party had something
of its own design. Purple, green,
white, and red in all sorts of combinations
and forms were displayed, while a coat, a
shirt, or even an improvised scarecrow
was not denied use.</p>

<p>So we went into water, our sleeves and
skirts being tied up and our legs bared to
the knees. Each was provided with a
basket and a hand-rake&mdash;except myself,
who, in addition to the implements, took
out secretly my net, wound round the poles.
My people were all too busy to observe
me, however. We went on raking for
clams. There seemed to be lots of black
or white shells which we did not want, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
I soon found that clams were rather a
matter of chance, and a chance would come
no more than once in every fifteen minutes!
I luckily struck on three nice ones
in a short time, and dug diligently for
some thirty minutes, but without any result.
So I grew tired, and began inspection.
Aunt had ten, mother eight, and
uncle five. When I approached him, he
looked up, red in the face. I wondered if
he was not angry. But it was not so, for
he heaved a sigh and straightening up and
striking his back with his fist, said, &#8220;O
dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle, you will soon be quitting your
job, just as I shall, I think,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! How many have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have more than that for
your lunch, you understand, unless you get
more. Now don&#8217;t be in my way.&#8221; And
again he doubled his corpulent body to
work. But I was right in thinking that he
could not keep himself in the same posture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
for another three minutes. Now I passed
on to Tomo-chan. Poor Tomo-chan had
only two! She was all but weeping for the
bad luck. She, however, looked comforted
to find that I did not fare much better.
But what was her surprise when I threw
all my clams in with hers!</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep them, Tomo-chan. I am going to
fish with this net.&#8221; Her eyes looked
gratitude. &#8220;Oh, thank you ever so much.
But I&#8217;ll catch fish with you if I don&#8217;t fare
any better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; And I went on thinking
that if I could not get clams for my lunch,
I should have fish to the envy of all. I
looked among the rocks for some shadow
of them. Surely I saw something shooting
away now and then, without waiting for
me to find out whether it was large or not.
But anyway, they were all right if I could
get a number of them, and so I fixed my
net and tried to drive them into it, little
thinking that the very whiteness of my net&mdash;I
appropriated a net made for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of keeping flies off&mdash;scared every
fish. I got irritated with my ill-success,
and finally splashed the water vigorously
to punish them.</p>

<p>By this time my uncle had quit his work,
as I predicted, and was engaging with hen-like
anxiety to look after his flock. He
kept his eyes on them, and would go like
a shepherd dog to fetch any one who went
too far away from the boat. He looked at
his watch to see if the tide was not turning
on, and went occasionally to the boat
to see if anything was lost. He seemed to
like this kind of work better than clam-fishing,
for I could see even from a distance
that he was pulling at his beard, as
he was wont to do when his mind was
occupied. Presently he heard me splashing
the water far away, and started at once
to bring me back. Time could not be lost,
he must have thought, but I did not know
anything of his approach till I heard a
shriek behind me. Surprised, I turned
round when I found him just recovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
his balance and looking intently into the
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s matter, uncle?&#8221; I hastened
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop. A flatfish somewhere.&#8221; Seeing
me with a net, he exclaimed, &#8220;Quick with
your net.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A flatfish?&#8221; I queried in excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I stepped on him and he gave me
a slip.... Oh, here he is; cover him
quick!&#8221; And we covered him with my
net without much ado. I was surprised to
see how easily I could catch him compared
with other fish that I had tried for. As
I raised him, however, I found he was
already crushed dead under my uncle&#8217;s
weight!</p>

<p>But it was a large one, and I could have
an honorable share at lunch.</p>

AN EVENING FÊTE</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">My Father&mdash;His Love for Potted Trees&mdash;A Local
Fête&mdash;Show Booths&mdash;Goldfish Booths&mdash;Singing
Insects&mdash;How a Potted Tree Was Bought.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Evenings</span> were not without enjoyment for
me. And for this I owe much to my
father.</p>

<p>My father was a silent, close-mouthed
man. His words to children were few and
mostly in a form of command. They were
never disobeyed, partly because it was
father who spoke, but more because we
knew that he spoke only when he had to.
Indeed, he carried a formidable air about
him, apparently engrossed in thought
somewhat removed from his immediate
concern. He was by no means philosophical,
however, and his reticent habit was
born of the peculiar circumstances under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
which he was laboring. Fortune was
evidently against him. And partly out of
sympathy with him and partly out of fear
of breaking his spell, when we had something
to ask of him&mdash;boys have many
wants&mdash;we had some indirect means to
devise. Thus, when my cap had worn out
and I wanted a new one, I dropped a hint
in his presence by way of a soliloquy:
&#8220;I wish I had a new cap. My old one is
worn out.&#8221; Saying this just once at a
time and thrice in the course of one evening,
if I persevered for three nights, I
used to have my old cap replaced with a
new one on the next day!</p>

<p>He knew that he was fighting against
odds, but his spirit was never crushed.
He only persevered. One day he came back
from his evening stroll with a piece of bamboo
flute. Evidently he was attracted by
a tune a man at the corner of a street was
playing on it as he sold his wares, and felt
his soul suddenly gain its freedom and soar
to the sky. I remember how well he loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
his instrument, and from day to day he
used to pour out low, mournful tunes. But
his art was never equal to the demand of
his soul, and one evening the bamboo flute
was laid aside for a pot containing a dwarf
pine-tree.</p>

<p>You may well wonder how a flowerless
potted tree could be preferred to even the
commonest tune for spiritual solace. But
at any rate it was a piece of nature, and
was healing to behold. And then, in its
fantastic shape, there was a beauty of repose
which had a very soothing effect, but
which required some study for appreciation.
But in his case, there was something
deeper in the matter. A tree over fifty
years old, which, if left in the field, would
have grown to an immense size, was reduced
by human art to only a foot in
height, and was kept alive on a potful of
earth. My father must have read a history
of his own in it and tried to learn a
secret of contentment from it.</p>

<p>One by one potted trees were added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
his stock,&mdash;he could afford to buy only
at odd intervals,&mdash;and presently shelves
were provided for them in the small garden.
Morning and evening he attended to
them, and with patience as well as with
pleasure looked forward to the time when
his care would result in a growth of just
an inch and a quarter of pine leaves and
palm leaves two inches by three in size.</p>

<p>One night an unexpected thing happened.
A thief found his way to the garden
from the back door and sneaked away
with half a dozen of the choice trees.
Naturally, my father was distressed, but
after a while he was patiently filling the
vacancy one by one, of course seeing that
the back door should be securely locked
every night.</p>

<p>I was going to tell you something about
the amusements I had in the evening, but
it was mainly due to this love of my
father&#8217;s for potted trees that I was taken
regularly to a local fête, held three times
a month. The day for this was fixed; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
fell on every day connected with, the number
seven; that is, the seventh, the seventeenth,
and the twenty-seventh. And as
in the calendar, rain or shine, it came and
went. Naturally, I had my weather bureau
open on that day to see if the evening was
all right, for a wet night would be an
irretrievable loss. At the police stand they
published a forecast in the morning, but
that was not to be too much relied on. It
sometimes said rain when it was anything
but wet, and fine when it was actually
drizzling&mdash;though in the latter case I
rather inclined to believe the report even
if it ended in sorrow.</p>

<p>I did not need any formality of asking
to be taken; it was a matter of course with
me as long as I behaved well. This behaving,
however, was peculiar. I had to
be waiting for my father outside and follow
him when he came out, without saying
anything or shouting for delight for a
block or so. The reason for this was
simple. Mother objected to sending out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
younger members of our family in the evening,
and especially to such a crowded
place where they were liable to be lost. My
going there must not attract their attention.</p>

<p>One evening I slipped off with my father
in this way. The place where the fête was
held was not far away, and after two or
three turnings we soon came to the street.
At a distance, you might take it for a fire,
for the tiny stalls and booths crowding the
place were lighted by hundreds of kerosene
torches which flared and smoked. The
central section of the street was not more
than two blocks in length, but it was literally
packed with six rows of booths and
stalls and with such a concourse of people
that there did not seem to be room even
to move.</p>

<p>The approach to the scene was marked
by some show booths. Hung in front were
some wonderful pictures of what was to
be seen within: a serpent over thirty feet
long, which had lived in some distant part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of the country and had actually swallowed
two babies; a woman who had a real rubber
neck which could be stretched so far
that while sitting still her head could wander
all over the house; monkeys dressed in
old-style costume and giving some theatrical
performance, and so on. The entrance
fee was a penny, and men stood outside
crying the various excellencies of their
shows, and when you stopped before one
of them and looked at the sign, they would
lift the curtain for a second and drop it
again, just to whet your curiosity. I naturally
wanted very much to look at some of
the monstrosities, and watched to see if
the inducement would work on my father,
but, much to my disappointment, he walked
calmly on with his hands in his sleeves.</p>

<p>Now we came in front of the goldfish
booths. It was simply fascinating to see
such a number of dear little things swimming
in wooden tubs, some being hung
high in glass globes by the side of helpless
turtles enjoying air riding. In the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
two or three booths were masses of minute
bamboo cages. Most of them were only
three inches by two. Here they were selling
all sorts of singing insects and fire-worms.
And what an orchestra these tiny
winged things were! There were bell
insects which chirped on &#8220;chinkororin,
chinkororin,&#8221; in staccato, crickets which
hummed in sweet undulating &#8220;rin&mdash;rin&mdash;rin,&#8221;
and katydids which broke in with
a cymbal-like &#8220;gaja, gaja,&#8221; as we say. I
watched to see if these things would tempt
my father, but no, his face was set on something
else ahead.</p>

<p>Now a great part of these enterprising
peddlers were gardeners by profession.
And out of the six rows of booths in the
central portion three were shows of potted
flowers and trees. They even had for sale
grown-up trees half as tall as a telegraph-pole!
As we came to this part my father
slackened his pace. Here was something
at last which interested him. He took time
to examine some of the nice potted trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and his progress was very slow indeed,
somewhat to my annoyance. I would
rather have him stop before a candy booth
than in these places. After a while, however,
he found one tree much to his liking.
He was tempted just to ask the price
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten dollars, sir,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>My father smiled dryly and passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much you give, Mister?&#8221; asked
the man.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it five dollars this time,
Mister,&#8221; cried the man. Still receiving
no answer, he came after us. &#8220;But give
me your price, Mister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty cents,&#8221; said my father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ough, that won&#8217;t pay even the express.
Give me a dollar, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>But my father was already some distance
away. The man, growing desperate
to lose him, cried aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mi-ster, you can have it for the price.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
This is the first one I have sold this evening.
I must start the sale, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>So my father came into possession of
one more potted tree. The price was low,
to be sure, but the man did not undersell
his goods.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing now to do
but to wend our way home as my father
turned round at the corner and came down
with the crowd. We passed toy booths,
basket booths, booths where hairpins with
beautiful artificial flowers were sold, or
where all sorts of fans, bamboo screens,
and sundry other things were for sale.
And we passed them apparently without
any interest, at least on my father&#8217;s part.
I was wondering what my father would
buy for me, when whom should I meet but
my aunt and Tomo-chan just going round
the street in the other way? I spoke with
Tomo-chan while my father and aunt
were exchanging some remarks&mdash;possibly
about the potted tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>&#8220;Did you get something bought for
you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet. I&#8217;ve just come, you
know. And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not say the rest as my father
and aunt parted and the crowd was pushing
between us, and so I waved my hand to
say good-by to Tomo-chan.</p>

<p>We soon came almost to the end of the
gay portion of the street, and after a few
booths a touch of festival air would be
gone, when my father halted before a
molasses candy booth, and, to my great
joy, bought a nickel&#8217;s worth of cake. We
got a big, swollen bagful; this was for me
and for our stay-at-home folks. I wished
that I had met Tomo-chan once more.</p>

SUMMER DAYS</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A Swimming School&mdash;How I Was Taught to Swim&mdash;Diving&mdash;The
Old Home Week&mdash;Return of the
Departed Souls&mdash;Visiting the Ancestral Graves&mdash;The
Memorable Night&mdash;A Village Dance.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> third summer in Tokyo had come.
The air was fresh and cool, while the
morning-glories in our back yard were
blooming lavishly, and the Ainu chrysanthemums
in white, pink, and purple, and
the late irises were seen carried round the
street in flower-venders&#8217; baskets. But it
soon got warmer as they vanished from
the sight till I found it hot even in one
piece of a thin garment over my body,
though my mother starched it for me just
stiff enough for the air to pass through
from one sleeve to the other.</p>

<p>In one of the canals near by, an annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
swimming-school was opened. The place
was inviting in hot weather, besides, it was
such fun to bathe with hosts of boys, and
to learn how to swim. I must confess that
I could not swim yet. I thought at first
that it was quite an easy thing, because I
often saw a man swimming with his feet
and performing such a trick with his hands
as peeling a pear with a knife and eating
it. But after a few trials I was obliged
to correct my notion to such a degree as
to consider swimming an extremely difficult
as well as dangerous undertaking.
Not only my body was found to be something
between a block of hard wood and
a stone, and much nearer to the latter, but
once it stayed so long in the water, head
and all, that I experienced pretty nearly
what it was to get drowned. But all this I
did in secret and did not tell to any of my
folks. Indeed my mother was keeping my
younger brother from the water by telling
him about the story of a sea-monkey who
would stretch his exceptionally long arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and drag people into the depths, especially
boys who went swimming against their
mother&#8217;s remonstrance. As an elder
brother, I was bound to set a good example.</p>

<p>A week after the opening of the school,
however, I brought the swimming matter
to my mother&#8217;s attention, and piling up
such reasons as I thought most expedient,
and rounding up by mentioning names of a
number of my schoolmates, as if they were
co-petitioners, who had been enrolled in
the membership, I wanted her to ask my
father. I had anticipated a refusal from
both mother and father, but my mother
was all right as long as the place was
safe, while my father surprised me by his
instant permission. He was an excellent
swimmer himself and must have felt it a
shame that his son did not know even
how to keep himself afloat. My poor
younger brother, however, was to wait
another year.</p>

<p>So I went to swimming. We had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
exciting time in the canal, and the heat of
the sun ceased to be of any trouble to me.
On the first day one of the trainers supported
me with his hands and made me
move my arms and legs according to his
instruction. I made a vigorous effort,
while he carried me on as if I were making
a progress myself. Now and then,
however, he would loosen his hold and see
if I could keep myself going. I was then
taken with sudden fear, and, feeling that
the water grew instantly to be very deep,
I gave a cry of horror and distress, and
did some splashing, too. The instructor
laughed over my plight and told me that I
should be safe as he was near, and that I
must try to acquire the sense of ease with
the water. As long as my limbs were
moving properly, I was sure to be floating.
So I put confidence in his words and
cultivated assiduously what he called the
sense of ease, which I understood to be a
suppression of fear. The first day, however,
passed without any result, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of my determination that I would go to the
bottom rather than call for help again.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, at the very first
unassisted trial on the second day, my
body did float. How joyful I felt at this,
you can hardly imagine. I swam round
and round the place&mdash;of course stopping
every quarter of a minute&mdash;till I was
fairly exhausted. On my return home,
however, I mustered courage enough to
impart to my brother on the matted floor
my successful experience in swimming.</p>

<p>Diving came next. On my first dip I
felt instinctively that man and fish were at
the opposite extremities of creation. The
suppression of breath and the closing of
eyes were bad enough; but there was such
a roaring in my ears as if all the watery
spirits were murmuring at the intrusion,
while my body was at once subjected to
a different law of repulsion. But it was
great fun to play at being a sea-monkey
and drag the legs of idle boys, at which
sport I had been a victim myself on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
very first day. So I began practising it,
and in a few days was already looking for
a chance to apply my half-mastered skill.
Seeing once two boys near me engaging in
splashing water, I plunged at once, aiming
at one of them. It was but a few yards
to dive, but I came out of the water without
striking anything, and before I had
time to brush off the dripping water from
my eyes, I was subjected to a furious spray
from the two boys, when, thud, came something
on my side, and in another second I
was dragged into the water. A mouthful
of water went down my throat before I
knew, and when I came to my feet with all
the water boiling around me, I noticed a
third and new boy standing and laughing
over his trick!</p>

<p>So passed a good part of the summer
till about the middle of August, when the
Japanese &#8220;Old Home Week&#8221; came. The
principal day falls on the sixteenth day
of the seventh month, according to the
lunar calendar, which is about a month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
after the ordinary date. It is a sort of
Decoration Day, too, because we go to the
temple yards and pay a visit to our ancestral
graves. Now for three years this
duty was neglected by us, and father
thought it proper for some one to visit the
old place in the country. My uncle was
also in a similar position, and it was arranged
that my aunt and Tomo-chan
should go from their family while I represented
my own. And two days before the
date we set out in a conveyance called a
kuruma.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite sure of the significance of
the graveyard visiting on this special occasion,
and so found time to ask my aunt
of it. And this was what she told me, not
on the road, but in her house the night
before we started. (I had known the inconvenience
of the kuruma in keeping me
separate from my aunt all the way, though
it had the decided merit, as it turned out,
of packing Tomo-chan and myself in one
seat.)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Now, when a man dies, he goes either
to paradise or to hell, according to Buddhism.
In the former place, he is led to
his seat on a large lotus flower floating
on the cool surface of the rippling water.
The sweet calmness of the summer morn
is all his, my aunt said, but beyond that
there seems to be nothing going on in that
floral berth. But in hell, all is excitement.
The king of devils will mete out punishment
to each arrival according to his
guilt, and he is made by red and green
demons to tread on the hill of swords, to
ride in the coach of fire, or to bathe in the
boiling caldron. But, good or bad, those
departed souls are allowed once a year to
pay a short visit to their earthly homes,
and this happens on the sixteenth of the
seventh month. So we go to the graves
of our ancestors, clean and decorate them
so that the dead may feel comfortable, and,
delivering our message of welcome and
turning about, ask the invisible to get on
our backs to our homes! I wondered if my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
back was large enough for the whole train
of my ancestors to ride on.</p>

<p>At my native village we stayed at another
uncle&#8217;s. A day&#8217;s ride in the same
narrow kuruma made Tomo-chan and me
more companionable than ever, while the
strangeness of the new place kept us two
always close by. Everywhere we were
welcomed as Tokyonians, and treated to
melons and rice dumpling. We had not,
however, much time to spare, for we were
quite busy seeing to our family graves.
We hired a man to weed and clean the lot,
sent enough offerings to the temple so
that the priests, when chanting for the
rest of the departed, might think comfortably
of it, and, above all, took care that
every grave might not lack fresh flowers
for two days, that is during our stay. On
the sixteenth day I was prepared to carry
any number of invisible spirits from the
graveyard to the house. But as some
one told me that the spirits would not dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to come in the daylight, I was glad that
my service was not needed, after all.</p>

<p>The sun set gloriously behind the castle,
and the mellow booming of the temple
bell was wafted through the evening air.
Presently the misty moon, just waning,
rose from the plain, and the memorable
night began. In every house the rooms
were swept clean and the tiny lights were
burning in the household shrine. In front,
the flames from a heap of flax stems, known
as the &#8220;reception fire,&#8221; were dazzling,
and, unheard and unobserved, the ghosts
of our fathers passed into the house.</p>

<p>I did not know how long they would
stay, but bowing once respectfully before
the shrine, I went out with Tomo-chan to
stay around. In the temple ground there
was an open space hemmed in by tall,
shady pines, where the young people of the
village would assemble that night and hold
the annual dancing. And naturally our
steps were directed there. We found that
already many of them were gathered, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
by the uncertain light of paper lanterns
hung here and there on the trees, we saw
that they were all dressed in uniform white
and blue garments, with folded pieces of
cloth dangling about their necks. The
browned faces of the swains were not distinguishable
in such dimness, but those of
the lasses looked distinctly lovely, the
scratches and blemishes incidental to their
outdoor occupation being invisible. The
swains grouped on this side and the girls
on the other; the former being not yet
bold enough, and the latter too shy, to
mingle with one another. Presently some
sweet-voiced lad sang a ballad, and then
all rose to arrange themselves in rows,
boys on one side and girls on the other.
They called to the singer to start anew,
and began to trip to the song, clapping
their hands at a rhythmic turn. They
never moved on, but closed in and again
drew apart on the same spot, all repeating
the same movement. It was a novel
thing for both of us, and we watched them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
with great delight. Song after song was
sung, all bursting into laughing cheers
after each piece and sometimes going into
such commotion that each lad paired with
his bonny lassie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that delightful?&#8221; I asked Tomo-chan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And simple, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s watch again and see if we can
learn,&#8221; I said to her, and we stood at the
end of the line.</p>

<p>The song went clear and plaintive and
the touching trill was preying upon the
hearts of the dancers and working them
into dreamy ecstasy. The moon by this
time climbed high up in the sky, and when
a filmy cloud glided off her face, the pale
weird rays revealed Tomo-chan and me
dancing in the group!</p>

THE ENGLISH SCHOOL</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A Night at the Dormitory&mdash;Beginning English&mdash;Grammar&mdash;Pronunciation&mdash;School
Moved&mdash;Mother&#8217;s
Love.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was September and the beginning of a
new term. Father decided that I should
leave the school I had attended hitherto
and go to another one where English was
taught. This was the second time that I
had left school without finishing it, but
I was destined not to fare any better at the
new place. Indeed, I changed school four
times without finishing, till I finally settled
in a college. But this leaping habit&mdash;I
am sorry to say that it took a semblance
of habit at last&mdash;did not come
from any changeableness on my or my
father&#8217;s part, but all from the sincere desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to prepare me for life in the best
way. This it was that drove me into the
three years&#8217; study of the Chinese classics,
though I beat a rather dishonorable retreat
from it, and again this it was that directed
me to take up the foreign languages
early. I was afraid, however, that I
leaped too much this time, as I found that
all my new schoolmates were much older
than I, and, indeed, there were some who
needed shaving every morning!</p>

<p>The school was at first very near to my
house. The building was of brick; the
first floor was used for the class-rooms and
the second was made into a dormitory.
This last was a novelty to me; I never
knew before that boys stayed away from
home in this fashion, and entertained a
secret desire to share a bed once with somebody,
just to see what it was like. This,
however, was easily granted, as I soon
grew to be a favorite with everybody because
of my youthfulness, and one night I
made a bundle of my night-shirt and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to the room of one of my classmates. I was
at once devoured with curiosity in watching
him make the bed. It was not such a
simple process as I used to see at home&mdash;laying
one or two quilts on the matted
floor and another over them. But he had
to build a bedstead first from a sliding
door, and placed one end of it on his
table and the other on his bookcases.
Upon that he laid his thin quilt and
blanket. I wondered why he had to do
such a crazy thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the reason?&#8221; He
seemed to be surprised at my ignorance.
&#8220;It is on account of the fleas. You can&#8217;t
sleep on the floor. Look here.&#8221; And he
showed me a bottle in which an army of
captured fleas were drowned. After all,
a dormitory was not a covetable place, I
thought. But there was some fascination
in the sliding door bed, which creaked like
a cuckoo with every move of my body.</p>

<p>But I must tell you about my first experience
in English. English was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
encouraging to start with. The alphabet
consists of only twenty-six letters, and
when I mastered that and was provided
with a handful of vocabulary, I felt as if
I were already half an American. I went
around and talked to everybody, especially
to those who did not know anything
of English, like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a dog. See the dog! It is a
cow. See the cow!&#8221; I could even play a
trick by way of variation like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a dog? Yes, it is a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>And my family, who were constantly
spoken to in this unknown tongue, were
surprised at my speedy progress.</p>

<p>And indeed I thought first that any number
of words might be easily learned, because
they were but combinations of
letters in one way or other, which are
limited to only twenty-six. But it did not
take me long to change this view. As the
length of the daily lesson increased I came
to wonder more and more whether the
English words were not charmed after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
They were as slippery as eels, and, indeed,
written like eels too. I thought time and
again that I had them secure in my mental
box, but when I opened the lid the next
day, they vanished like a spirit. Something
must be done, I thought, to tie them
down, and so I invented a certain scheme.
It was that when I looked up a new word in
my Anglo-Japanese dictionary, I put a
black mark beside it to show that on that
very moment it passed into my possession.
The plan seemed to work very well, but
before long I found I had to mark the
same words three or four times, till my
dictionary looked very much as if it were
suffering from spotted fever!</p>

<p>Then came grammar. Grammar is the
least familiar part of language study.
We are never taught in that in learning
vernacular Japanese. Somehow words
come out of our mouths naturally and
arrange themselves into smooth sentences.
So when I had to commit to memory the
definitions of the noun, verb, adjective, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
so forth, and to classify English words
into them, I came to doubt if I were not
studying botany instead of language.
Fortunately I did not make such a mistake
as, &#8220;A verb is something to eat,&#8221; or
&#8220;Every sentence and the name of God
must begin with a caterpillar.&#8221; But it
took me months to understand the difference
between the transitive and intransitive
verbs. I finally struck an original
definition of them. It is this, that a verb
is called transitive when it is ambitious
and intransitive when it is not, because
in the former case it takes an object and in
the latter it does not. I wondered why
some one among the learned teachers did
not tell me that right away in the beginning.
It would have saved me a lot of
trouble. Again in parsing, any word
parading with a capital was a relief to
me: I had no hesitation in giving it as a
proper noun, whether it appeared in the
main body of a piece or&mdash;in the title!</p>

<p>Now there is one little part of speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
which puzzled me a great deal. It is the
article. In translation I had the great
satisfaction of passing it over entirely, as
we have no equivalent to it in Japanese,
but in composition it was the first thing
that puzzled and annoyed me. The Japanese
formerly went out bareheaded, and
their language is also free from this encumbrance
of a head-gear&mdash;for the article
is a head-gear to a noun&mdash;and I was liable
to drop off the article entirely, or, if I
tried, to use a wrong one every time.
Surely this hat etiquette was difficult and
capricious, too. I thought I could master
its secret if I knew thoroughly when and
what sort of a bonnet a girl should wear&mdash;of
course including the case of wearing
a derby on horseback! This occurred to
me a long time afterward in America, however.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120f.jpg" alt="A Japanese School of the Present Day" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Japanese School of the Present Day.</span></p>

<p>Let me mention another difficulty.
This was the pronunciation. A number of
new sounds were introduced, the most
conspicuous of which are those in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
th, l, f, and v are found. The th-sound
was bad enough, but l was next to impossible.
Finding this to be the case, an
American teacher would draw a cross-section
of a face on the blackboard, only
with a scant outline of the mouth and nose
(once he drew the head, too, but it caused
an unusual amount of merriment among
the boys, as it was as bald as his, and he
never finished the picture again), and explain
the position of the tongue in uttering
the sound, which we industriously copied.
And he also would have us say, &#8220;Rollo
rode Lorillard,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Present,&#8221;
or &#8220;Here,&#8221; when the roll was called.
But the semi-historical passage fell from
the boys&#8217; lips rumbling like a thunder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rorro rode Rorirrard!&#8221;</p>

<p>One year passed happily in the new
school, when it moved to its new buildings
on the other side of the city, about five
miles away. It was at first a short walk
from my house, but when it increased from
two minutes to two hours, with no convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of street-cars to help my feeble
feet, I naturally hesitated to go. I had
to walk if I continued to attend, as boarding
out in the dormitory was too expensive
for our means. The school, however,
was too good to be given up at that time,
and so I made up my mind not to discontinue
it.</p>

<p>To cover ten miles a day, spending four
to five hours, was not a light task for a boy
of thirteen. It was all I could do on fine
days. In stormy weather the feat would
become a struggle, and I was more than
glad to accept the kind offer of one of my
schoolmates to break the trip at his home
for the night.</p>

<p>I had to start early to be on time at
the eight o&#8217;clock exercise. Five o&#8217;clock
was the time for me to get up, but my
mother rose at least at half-past four to
make me a hot breakfast of boiled rice
and bean soup.</p>

<p>My mother was the sort of woman who
expresses herself in work rather than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
words. And in this she was regularity
itself. One thing which impressed me in
this more than anything else was her
management of my dresses. Japanese
decency requires eight suits a year for any
one just for ordinary use, and of course I
needed, or rather my mother believed that
I needed that: eight suits&mdash;four in summer,
two in winter, and one each in spring
and in autumn. The dresses were not
always made from new pieces, and so gave
much more trouble. She made over the
old clothes, washed and turned or dyed,
if necessary, before doing so. My notion
of her regularity, however, must be augmented
five times, as she was doing the
same thing&mdash;though I did not notice it at
the time&mdash;with the other members of the
family.</p>

<p>And so this early rising on her part for
my sake went like clockwork morning
after morning. If this means steadiness
of her devotion to her son and to all related
dearly to her, she had it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Again she was not wordy in any case.
I never had a long lecture from her,
though, I am sorry to say, I had some short
ones. On the contrary, she had the secret
of speaking in silence. There was some
magic power in her touch. I love to look
back to my childhood, when she used to
dress me in the morning, at the end of
which she would whisper in my ear just a
word: &#8220;Be good all the day, dear child.&#8221;
It was simply pleasure.</p>

<p>So at this hour when the world was still
asleep, as I sat without a word at a short
morning repast before her, with the
lamp shining and every manifestation of
motherly love around me, I was under an
unspeakable spell, and learned to love her
most.</p>

<p>I had to start soon, however. I descended
to the door and opened it. It was
still dark and the sky was starry. There
was something that held me back for a
moment. But I took heart and went out.
Mother wanted to go with me for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
distance. Naturally, I declined the offer,
wishing not to seem cowardly, but also because
I did not want to give her such a
trouble. So she just stood at the door
with a lantern and saw me off till I turned
the corner.</p>

<p>I thought she turned and stepped inside
after that, as I heard the noise of the
sliding door being shut, and, being satisfied,
I hurried on my way. But one morning
something happened that revealed the
truth. There was a bridge at the second
turning, two blocks away from my house,
and from that a long street ran. I was
away some distance on this road when one
of the fastenings of my clog-straps broke
off. It is sad when this occurs. We cannot
walk at all. We should be provided
with material for repair, but it seldom
happens that we are. To return was to
lose time, and I must be going. So I did
what boys usually do under such a circumstances.
I hunted a wedge-shaped pebble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and, holding the broken end of the fastening
in the hole, where it had been kept
tight, drove it with another piece of stone.
I was able to walk a short distance, but
again it broke off. I was irritated, but
there was no use in fussing: so I again
went patiently to repair. I was hammering
the clog with a stone when I heard
the noise of hurried steps approaching. I
was too busy to look back, but a voice came
which made me drop the stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sakae!&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned, and there my mother stood
with a strip of cloth ready to help me! I
was surprised, but was too glad for help
to ask any question.</p>

<p>As I trod on, I reasoned to account for
her appearance in this way: that after
seeing me turn the corner, my mother was
wont to put out the light, shut the door,
and follow me to the bridge, and from
there was watching to see that I was safe.
She saw that day that I was in trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and divined the whole case by the knocks
I gave at the clog. So she was there with
her help. As I thought of that, a silent
tear trickled down my cheek.</p>

A BOY ASTRONOMER</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">What I Intended to Be&mdash;My Aunt&#8217;s View&mdash;My Parents&#8217;
Approval&mdash;My Uncle&#8217;s Enthusiasm&mdash;The
Total Eclipse of the Sun.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> all ambitious boys, I now began to
dream of my future.</p>

<p>In a daily paper to which we were subscribing,
there was a story appearing in
serial form, which I happened to read, and
in which I became immediately interested.
It was a scientific novel, with a revenge
motive. The title, the author, the plot&mdash;all
are now forgotten except the vague idea
that the hero in the end, by his high inventive
ability, built a wonderful machine,
by means of which he poured poisonous
gas into the castle where his enemy lived,
and thereby took his vengeance upon him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
I was simply fascinated, and wanted to be
an engineer.</p>

<p>The first one to whom I confided my intention
was Tomo-chan. Of course I did
not and could not depict an engineer as the
one in the story, wrapped in the glowing
splendor of his intellectual triumph. I
might have tried it if she had given me
a chance to do so. But too soon her peculiar
and perhaps truer view of the profession
came on me like a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t an engineer a sort of carpenter?&#8221;
she asked. Reduced to such a
lowest term, even my hero looked shabby,
and from that very moment I dropped him
entirely.</p>

<p>I was not, however, fortunate enough
to find a substitute worthy of my admiration,
and I had to go without any. But
this time my mind seemed to be able to
present to me a proper object of my
ambition. All my thought gradually
drifted toward the province of science (I
little knew then that it was the same engineer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
story which influenced me). Of all
branches of learning, science appeared to
me to be the most substantial, most worthy
of serious study, and most certain of
arriving at the secret of the creation. The
study, however, of a small portion of
God&#8217;s work, such as a leaf of a tree or a
nameless insect, did not appeal to me. No,
any section of the earth was not large
enough to lay down my life for. I wanted
to take in the earth, the sun, the moon, the
planets, and the stars&mdash;in fact, all the
universe at once! So I fixed upon astronomy
as my special study. The immensity
of the field and the purely theoretical
nature of the subject, coupled with the
transcendency of the pursuit over the
triviality of worldly affairs, had all its
charm over me. It was simply great.</p>

<p>I went again to Tomo-chan to tell her of
my intention. The idea of an astronomer
was apparently beyond her grasp. She
could not think of any occupation such as
carpenter, mason, and so forth, to associate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with an astronomer, and it did not take
her long to admit that it was grand.</p>

<p>This was my first triumph, and now I
approached my aunt to see what she would
think of it. She was one of those women
whose mind never soared above the world
even for the sake of observation. She
could not conceive the idea that this earth&mdash;which,
by the way, was flat, according to
her view&mdash;revolves every day. I went
into a whole length of explanation by the
help of a lighted lamp and my fist, to show
how the revolution would cause day and
night, but to no purpose. So I changed
my tactics and told her the story of a little
girl, who, in her own way, understood this
fact. She lived at the foot of a high mountain,
on the summit of which there was a
lake. The little girl could not understand
how water could be found in such a high
place till she was told one day about the
diurnal revolution of the earth. &#8220;That
must be true,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
mountain dips into the sea in the night
and carries the water from there!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not my purpose to convince
her about such a matter, and so I proceeded
to acquaint her with my intention.
I soon found that it was not exactly in the
line of her approval. She presented to me
at once her worldly view of the profession,
how out of ordinary my choice was. The
astronomer was to her a man who sleeps
when all should be up, and is awake when
all should be in bed. He looks always at
the sky, and does not know often that he
is about to tumble into a ditch. He has to
perch on a roof or a tree-top like a sparrow,
to watch the stars while everybody
is enjoying some nice thing in the house.</p>

<p>This, however, had no effect of a wet
blanket upon me. I knew that she was
teasing me for the mere fun of it. Her
humorous eyes were ready to take in any
change in my surprised countenance, which
on my part I partly assumed to please her.</p>

<p>In the end, however, she frankly admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that the constantly increasing number
of new studies in these enlightened
days bewildered her greatly, and she
could not tell which profession was sure
to lead one to success. Perhaps I was
right, she said, in choosing a study which
only a few might attempt.</p>

<p>Two days passed, in the course of which
I became surer of my choice and was ready
to face my parents. I had a secret suspicion
that my father might have some
plan already laid out for me. If he had
had anything in mind outside of a scientific
pursuit, I should have been non-plussed.
But, luckily, I found I was ahead
of him; indeed, he and my mother, too,
seemed to trust everything to my natural
inclination, and had only a vague but
bright future for me without any particular
road leading to it. So, when I laid
before them, side by side, my desire or
rather my determination to become an
astronomer and a future college professor,
with an income four times as great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
as my father&#8217;s,&mdash;I reserved the poetic
side of my choice for my own meditation,&mdash;I
made such a deep impression on
them that it surprised me altogether. My
mother, bending over her sewing by lamp-light,
silently passed her hand over her
eyes, while my father picked up a paper
which had been read all through, with a
slightly drawn &#8220;Um,&#8221; in his throat,
which in his case was to be interpreted as
indicating some pleasant feeling. My
mother was the spokesman in such a case
when my father&#8217;s silence was meant for
consent. She told me that one must go
heart and soul into any sort of study in
order to excel in it. I simply nodded, and
presently went to bed with a light heart,
after bidding good night to the dear little
stars who would be my constant companions
hereafter.</p>

<p>I could not meet my uncle till Sunday,
but Tomo-chan told me that he heard
everything about me from my aunt, and
was very enthusiastic over my intention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Indeed, he was always enthusiastic over
new things, though his enthusiasm was
usually rather short-lived. But I was
glad that my news struck him in that
light. That morning I found him reading
a paper, but as I approached he looked up,
and, removing his spectacles, and combing
his beard with his fingers, surveyed
me awhile as if to see if I was capable of
my word. But really he was waiting for
the return of his enthusiastic mood. I felt
that Tomo-chan was smiling over my situation
from the next room, though I could
not remove my eyes from my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Astronomer, eh?&#8221; he said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Going to be one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s grand. You will be the fourth
or fifth in that line in our country. I
should take one of those new studies if
I were young enough. But astronomy is
indeed fascinating. Do you know that the
moon never shows her other side?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he rose up and began to pace the
room. His enthusiasm served to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
back a flood of the shallow but ready
knowledge which he stored up in a corner
of his head. And he did not let me speak a
word till he had finished a lecture on the
solar system.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221;&mdash;he turned to me with
the look of a man who made a sudden discovery,&mdash;&#8220;do
you know of the solar
eclipse we are going to have on the 20th?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course I did. It was still two weeks
thence, and the moon was as opposite as
could be, but I had already darkened a
piece of glass over a candle and begun to
observe the sun at least once a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the total eclipse and its rare
opportunity. You may not see it again in
Japan in your lifetime,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>In my lifetime was too strong a phrase,
but I was very sorry to miss the chance,
as the zone of the total eclipse passed
some fifty miles north of Tokyo, and I
had&mdash;no money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps in your lifetime, too,&#8221; I
ventured to suggest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, indeed. I did not think of myself,&#8221;
he laughingly said. &#8220;Well, then,
let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take you and Tomo with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the adjoining room Tomo-chan was
seen just raising both her outstretched
hands, opening her mouth, and rolling her
eyes&mdash;all bespeaking her joy and surprise.
I wished very much to answer the
signal but for the presence of my uncle,
who kept staring at anybody or anything
near him, and this time at me, while revolving
some new plan in his mind.</p>

<p>For the intervening days I was busy
making preparations for the expedition.
I had to buy half a dozen pieces of glass,
frame and darken them in a variety of
shade; to adjust my watch to keep time;
to study the constellation where the sun
was, and note the stars of the first magnitude
visible on the day; and to make four
or five copies of a drawing with a graduated
circle in the centre for the sun, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
two other concentric circles for the orbits
of Mercury and Venus. The difficult part
of the business was how to record time
for the beginning of the eclipse. We
needed two, at least, for this. Tomo-chan
was glad to offer her service, but she did
not want to look at the watch but at the
sun. Well, I had no objection to that, as
long as she could tell the right moment.
But as I was a little in doubt on that point,
we spent several nights in drill by means
of a shaded lamp which cast a bright disc
on the wall. No sooner than I moved an
opaque one and touched the other, she had
to press my hand. But too often the
movable disc was a quarter of an inch
inside the other when the belated touch
passed on to me. So I had to train her
eyes first by giving a signal at the time of
contact by means of a pinch. And if she
did not perceive it still, she got pinched
still harder. She was very unteachable
in this respect, but still wanted to look at
the sun rather than the watch!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>So the day of the eclipse arrived. It
was a hot, clear day in July, and most
fitted for the observation. We took an
early train, as we had a long way to go,
and then we must settle somewhere to
watch the beginning and the end and the
most precious middle. In the central part
of the zone of the total eclipse there was
a government observatory temporarily
erected, and we wanted to get as near to it
as possible. But we did not take into account
the rather slow service of the train,
and the hour for the eclipse had come
before we got into the zone, and were, of
course, in the train. As nothing could
be done under such circumstances, we gave
up the initial observation, and all the three
just looked at the sun through the soot-covered
pieces of glass. We did not know
that we were a gainer and not a loser by
this till late, except Tomo-chan, who had
already earned enough pinches merely to
be ready for the occasion.</p>

<p>The train was a few miles within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
zone when my uncle thought it wise to
stop at a small village and make an observation
there, as the sun was fast being
overshadowed. We settled in a nice tea-house,
whose front room in the second
floor with an open veranda was just the
sort of place for our purpose. And there,
after a quick lunch, we awaited the hour.
Tomo-chan and I had a board and a sheet
of paper which I had specially prepared,
to note the location of the visible stars
and to draw the shape of the corona.</p>

<p>I never knew that the light of the sun
was so strong, for till the luminous surface
was reduced to a very thin crescent,
no change was observed in the sky. But
all at once, as the shadow of a man passing
on the street became weirdly faint, the
color of the sky turned into warm steel-black
and the purple stars began to
shine! And in no time the crescent was
changed into a mere speck of silver light,
and in a second, as it burned itself off, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
beautifully soft fringe of twilight appeared.
That was the corona!</p>

<p>I now assiduously set about to take down
the exact shape of it. There were only
thirty seconds of this precious moment.
So I just put down important points on the
paper, noting carefully the position and
the distance, and tried to take a clear impression
in my mind to be traced out later.
Tomo-chan was working, too. But her
process was just the opposite of mine.
Evidently she wished to follow my picture,
but as mine was no picture, she
turned to the sun with a sigh, and, though
she finished it in time, she had a picture
of a heavenly corona twisted considerably
by an earthly wind!</p>

<p>The wonderful moment had now passed,
and the corona, with a tail trailing at the
right-hand side of the sun, disappeared
like a dream. It was too brief, but we
were satisfied, and did not know what to
think of our good fortune when, three
minutes later, a dark cloud came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
brushed the sun off. Then we imagined
what the consequence might have been if
the train had been fast and we had gone on
further north. The next day&#8217;s paper said
that the government expedition was entirely
spoiled on account of the untimely
shower!</p>

IN THE SUBURBS</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A Novel Experiment&mdash;Removal&mdash;Our New House&mdash;Angling&mdash;Tomo-chan&#8217;s
Visit.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were now to remove to the suburbs.
Father got a better position with a firm
quite far from our house, and it was
thought expedient for us to do so for his
convenience.</p>

<p>There was one thing which made me dislike
this change. And it was about Tomo-chan.
We should be separated, and might
not see each other so often; all the more
so as we had grown to be quite intimate
and congenial by this time and had great
fun in indulging in some novel experiment
now and then. This last was by no means
of a scientific nature. Still we went at it
with something of scientific spirit to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
whether a certain innovation was applicable
or not.</p>

<p>Here is one such experiment we tried.
Tomo-chan heard from one of her friends,
whose sister recently came home from
America, that in that enlightened country
when a lady and a gentleman take a walk
together, the latter offers his arm to the
former, who, of course, never hesitates to
take it. Tomo-chan thought it was a fine
idea, and asked me if we might try it.
Well, I had no objection if it were only
dark enough to make the trial. So one
evening, under the shade of cherry-trees,
we hooked our arms. Our cumbersome
sleeves were somewhat in the way, but
still we got on famously. After that,
whenever we were in the dark, a hint would
come from Tomo-chan to walk in that
fashion, and I was only glad to accept it.
Curiously enough it was the girl who suggested
it every time!</p>

<p>Of course we were not uniformly successful.
I well remember the evening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that memorable day of the total eclipse.
My uncle&#8217;s enthusiasm greatly abated as
the event of the day passed, and as we
alighted from the train and stood before
a fruit-vender&#8217;s stall, he now appeared
to be much interested in a large watermelon.
Unable to resist the temptation,
he bought one and had me carry it. So I
held it under my arm and walked on. The
street was not crowded and the night was
dark, and I went on behind my uncle with
Tomo-chan beside me, when a touch was
felt at my unoccupied arm. It was the
well-known hint, and in no time Tomo-chan
and the watermelon were hanging from
my arms. It was not an easy thing to walk
in that way, especially behind the back of
my uncle, who might turn round to see us
at any moment. Then I found that even a
watermelon had a bit of jealousy in it,
for every minute it would get heavier and
more unmanageable as my mind inclined
more and more to my fair companion.
The point was soon reached when it was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
longer endurable for the watermelon, and
at my unguarded moment it jumped out of
my arm to commit suicide. The bounce at
once made my uncle turn and wring his
hands for anger at my carelessness. I
was equal to the occasion, however.
Quickly extricating myself from Tomo-chan,
I pounced at the sulky thing before
a word was spoken, and saved it from any
harm. So we went on as before. Only
both my arms were now taken by the
watermelon, and poor Tomo-chan dragged
on crestfallen.</p>

<p>But such fun we could no longer have
now that we were to be separated for a
time at least, and we parted with heavy
heart.</p>

<p>The removal was a curious affair. On
five or six carts, everything in the house
from paper screens to a kitchen stove was
piled up. There was an old pomegranate-tree
in the back yard which we had brought
from the country some six or seven years
ago. And of course we dug it up carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and loaded it on the cart. Also we did
not forget to pull down long poles for drying
purpose and add them to the heap,
together with two or three round stones
for pressing pickles. The train of the
carts pulled by coolies then moved slowly
on through the city, and it was after dark
before we could unload them at the destination.</p>

<p>The new house was in a charming spot.
Just back of us was a low hill thickly
wooded with tall oaks and criptomerias;
to the left across a brook stretched a
tilled field, fringed in the far distance with
bamboo bushes and elm groves; to the
right and on the hill the eye could command
the western horizon where Fujiyama
hung low like an azure fan against the
golden sky. The birds sang, the flowers
bloomed, the fire-worms glowed, and I
never felt a change so delightful, coming
as I did from a town where boys believed
that Indian corn either grew on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
tree, or sprang, like bamboo shoots, from
the ground without planting.</p>

<p>My school came to be much nearer; the
potted trees of my father increased; a
baby was added to our family; and, as the
sun and the moon moved on peacefully,
we were all well contented with our lot.</p>

<p>There was not much to be recorded for
our purpose in those days except the
angling my father and I had occasionally
in a river. His was always a calm turn
of mind, and the soothing, restful pastime
of fishing suited him immensely. I love
to picture him sitting under the sheltering
pine-tree by a quiet river bank, and
handling the rod and line, while quaint
ripples of smiles came and went across
his face as the nibbling fish gave his
line a tantalizing pull. Once, when it
was the season of smelt in the month of
May, we went over to a stream about two
miles off. The scene around there was
lovely. The mass of fresh leaves covered
the open field, and along the slope of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
bank, with stunted willows here and there,
myriads of dandelions like golden stars
studded the green. And the breeze was
fanning leisurely the warmth of the May
sun. The stream was shallow, and was
singing and foaming on the pebbly bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what we can do about here,&#8221;
said my father, as he selected a spot where
the water was going on in a cataract.
And we cast our flies and tried our luck.
But, after awhile, having no success, I
began to doubt if my father had chosen the
right spot, and so I thought that I had
better follow up the river and see if they
bit. I left my father to his fortune and
started on my adventure. I did not know
that smelt-fishing was such a dull business,
for, wherever I went, there was the
foaming pool, the steady flow, and there
were practically no bites. Yes, there was
one, but I only fished a piece of some rotten
wood or dripping moss! I wondered
what my father was doing, and, not without
a smile over his probable ill-luck, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
went back, when I found him still standing
in the same spot. I doubted if he was not
going to take root there. I at once inquired
about his success. &#8220;No, nothing
remarkable,&#8221; he gently replied, dreaming
on the sparkling water. I went to his
basket dipped in the river, and lifted the
lid, when a large prisoner, disturbed by
the jar I gave, snapped violently! After
all, I thought, he was of a piece with Izaak
Walton.</p>

<p>So days passed, and more than a year
rolled on since our removal. It was now
the latter part of October, when one day
we had unexpected visitors. They were
my aunt and Tomo-chan. This was not
their first visit since we came here, but I
had always been out and had had no
chance to meet them. Still, they did not
come very often, and so my aunt, with
many bows, apologized for her negligence
to call, while my mother, with equal courtesy,
was not behind the guest in heaping
up apologies for neglect on her part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Then, as tea and cakes were produced, inquiry
after the health and condition of
each member of the family issued from
both sides, and was answered modestly,
followed by amiable comment from the
inquirers. Then, with equal lightness of
heart, the season was talked over, the
recent events, and, indeed, anything of
timely interest.</p>

<p>While such a talk was going on my eyes
were secretly on Tomo-chan. I was surprised
at her change. I left her a mere
child only a year and a half ago, but the
bud of yesterday was the flower of to-day.
With a snowy neck and rosy cheeks, her
ebony hair done up stylishly, she sat in
striped silk of light azure and dove-gray.
She no longer looked at me straight, but,
except for furtive glances, her eyes
sought her jewelled hands, idly occupied
in clasping and unclasping on her knees.
A glow of bashfulness was beaming from
her as most eyes sought their focus in
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>As the talk was about to become more
personal, my mother suggested that Tomo-chan
might go out with me as a guide to
look around the place, which was beautiful
at that time. My aunt seconded the
motion, and asked me to take the trouble
of doing so. So there was no need of
hesitation, and in the next moment we were
out for a walk on a country road.</p>

<p>At first we were speechless. She appeared
to me no longer approachable with
the familiarity of &#8220;Tomo-chan.&#8221; But
as the autumnal breeze cooled down her
bashfulness, and the beauty of the scenery
was absorbing her attention more and
more, I ventured to falter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomo-chan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with her eyes beaming
with laughter, and there was the same
old innocent childhood, but where was the
bashfulness?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you find this beautiful?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so beautiful yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to say that you had a sudden
frost last night that tinged the
leaves?&#8221; she archly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, more sudden than that; it got
to be lovelier this very afternoon. We&#8217;ve
had something better than a frost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it possible?&#8221; She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No stranger than that you are changed
so <i>beautifully</i> in a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said what I should not have said, for
she blushed to the roots of her hair, and
I repented of my forwardness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But come along, Tomo-chan. I&#8217;ll
show you what you have not seen yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I took her over the hill and pointed
to the faint shadow of the peerless mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Fujiyama!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Oh, how lovely! Could you see that
every day from here?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Not in rainy weather.... But she
wanted to see you to-day, as everybody
else did, and waited there from morning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>&#8220;I wish you would thank her for that,
Sakae-san.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought first to thank him who told
her about your coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she smilingly said, &#8220;but don&#8217;t
tell me his name now, as I want to repay
him afterwards&mdash;abundantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I touched her dimple as she said so, and
then we went to the secluded part of the
hill where the crimson branches of maples
were projecting from the green background,
the red frosted &#8220;crows&#8217; melons&#8221;
festooned high on the criptomerias, and
the wild chrysanthemums were blooming
lavishly. In such a charming spot Tomo-chan
was a child of thirteen, and wanted
me to take &#8220;crows&#8217; melons&#8221;&mdash;I wonder
if she remembered the watermelon
incident?&mdash;and to gather chrysanthemums,
and laughed and sang to her
heart&#8217;s content. She was her old very
self. As the setting sun was resting on
her shoulder, I decked her hair with wild
flowers, and whispered in her ear that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
would remember evermore the day we
spent together. She nodded, and smiled
the sweetest of smiles.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
